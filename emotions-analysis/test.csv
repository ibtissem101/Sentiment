25,"Could be good if basic features like icons weren't locked behind a paid subscription. Update: your calling THEMES an advanced feature because you want to not because it is one.... Sorry but changing the background color to black, which it should be in the first place isn't an advanced feature, it's about one line of code. I'm a software engineer myself and know the difference between the two. Same goes for icons which are essentially to app functionality. Check out Notion for a great example."

31,"brilliant! I absolutely adore this app. so easy to set up, makes using google calendar for agendas even easier than just using google calendars! the events on the clock face just clicked instantly for me, the fact that they can be colour coded is delightful. the widget is great, and even shortcuts from there can be personalised. I got the pro version even though the free one does everything you need it to. having 24 hour option is good though, and even more colour customisation now. LOVE it!!"
32,Type cold in my room
33,"Okay, so the only reason I`m not buying this app is because I hate EA and all that it stands for. SimCity rocks though.  http://is.gd/JpMM"

55,"I don`t have MTV,. What am I going to DO?!! fmlllll"
56,"Downloaded the app so I could have a widget with my list on my home screen. shortly thereafter, tney added checkboxes, which can't be turned off, making it easy to accidentally ""complete"" a task on the widget. And unlike when you have the app open, this can't be undone. It was good when I downloaded it, but is now completely useless."
57, i agree with  spongebob is better

64,"Brilliant app. Would be great if attachments were supported too, but this is the best calendar app by a mile for my many calendars. Also - if you don't like ads, buy the bloody thing! Developers aren't charities, and i'm fairly sure you wouldnt do your job for nothing! Don't be cheap dudes."
65," Oh yea, my pain went down a little bit from laughing so hard which was good and nice for once."

70, Spending a weekend doing nothing but being domestic ? You said it!
71,"I love this app, it's the only one I've found which combines tasks and habits in a simple way. However, I do get frustrated that I can't seem to change the scheduling of a habit after I've set it up. E.g. If it's set for once a week and I want to make it twice I have to delete it and create a new one. Can you please fix this"
72, Yes we did!  Thank You!!

88,"I like that this app notifies you for tasks, but it should respect Android system's Do not Disturb!! I shouldn't be reminded when I sleeping and I explicitly turn off notifications (no other app I have notifies me in Do not Disturb mode)"
89,Quite disappointed with this app. Is used to be fine for past years. Currently is really slow when checking my task and is so frustrating at times. This app need improvement on the server and at times server down :(.
90,"Since recent update adverts make the free version absolutely unusable! I understand some adds have to be in the free version, but full screen adds are very disruptive in a calendar app when one needs to work quick :/ ..otherwise the functionality it great"

94,Heres the thing. I love this app and the idea behind it. But for some reason its so dang glitchy. Pages wont always change when i scroll. Tasks dont refresh. I often have to completely close the app. Help! Very willing to change this review to 5 stars if we get this figured out.
95, just need to know what to be cautious about.  being cautious is good.
96, Goodnight!!!!!!

107,"The reminders are helpful, and the app is easy to use, especially when tracking more than one habit. My only quibble is that when i changed phones, it didn't port my records over like the instructions said they would. But I did at least download the records ahead of time. EDIT: I returned to this app after a hiatus, and not only had it deleted my data, it also essentially deleted me! I can't log in, and when I try to register, it says my email address is already taken."

117,"Overall it works, but not so easy to use. When you block out time the first and last day of the time block do not turn the same color as the rest so it can throw you off. Sometimes it's hard to set specific dates and the icons are limited."
118,Just a awesome app!! Update: This app has really helped with my adhd! Still love the app. Now if I could do email from it. It would be the best app I have ever downloaded.

131,"Hey，the idea is very good,but why don't you let me sync my phrases?And I can't login in other phones It reminded me to buy...."
132,"PRO: The functionality and UI are one of the best of these kinds of apps. Everything has a simple look to it, but you can always go deep, add a reminder here, a folder there and do exactly what you want it to do. CON: The feature I want the most (more than 5 repeatable tasks, ""habits"") is locked behind a subscription paywall, and there is no reason for a subscription model. I'd gladly drop a reasonable one time payment for it, but not the asking price month after month, I'm not rich and nether is my country. All in all great if you can afford it, frustratingly limited if you can't."

139,So my first aid shift started out with some excitement but now it`s kinda died down...  I wish I could do this more often!
140,It seems the app is not build for longer and more complex use. It looks like it can be used for people that plan to follow and develop their behaviour but the level of this app is of a game. Takes too long for resolving the bugs and no reaction to feedback. App crashes when using the calendar options. This should not happend when using payed version of the app. Waiting for improvement or giving up using and paying for this app.

208,"One of the most expensive apps I have ever seen or tried. Everything costs money. Subscription? Check. Paid themes? Check. I mean, I spent a fortune on apps, and I am in favor of continuous support, but still. Losing my lifetime savings is just not okay. Reminds me of the app Newton Mail where they went from free to Oh My God This Is Expensive. IMO users would sub way more if the options were affordable. Sorry for 2/5 but if an app is inaccessible due to prices, I can't say that it's an ok app"

282,Very simple & easy to use reminder/list system. Not a lot of Fluff & Complications a lot of other programs like this do. But just switched from a 5 to a 4 star as security program showed all of my device info is being sent to Facebook servers in CA? Please tell me developer is not selling my info to Facebook??? Developer has not refuted this for quite a while now?
283,"This app (and Google add-on) is amazing, even the free version. However, the new widget is worse than the old one. One major reason I say that is because the old version allowed overdue tasks to be rescheduled with a single touch. In this new one, so far, you have to go back into the app."
284,"Doesn't sync properly anymore. Have been using the free version of this calendar app with my Google calendar for years without problems. But for the last half year or so, the appointments don't sync, the invites don't get sent. It has become unusable and unreliable. I have had to switch to the Google calendar app now."

313,"Honestly L O V E this app already and I've only had it for, like, 30 minutes but there seems to be a small bug after the timer finishes. I don't know if it's intentional but the pop up that gives you coins just keeps... Popping up? I get 10 coins, I press ""okay"" then another pop up comes, giving me another 10 coins. It doesn't end until I have to remove the app from my history. Despite that this is an AMAZING app for studying ❤️"
314,can`t believe I`m leaving this place tomorrow.
315,"The best habit tracking app I've ever used. Set your own goals, no comments that make you feel guilty, and minimal annoying reminders."

368, Agreed! Though Eclipse apps hinder collecting the heap dump by catching OOME. Had to muck about in JConsole
369,"The app is amazing. One feature or suggestion I would like to suggest would be to start planting a tree at some given time as set by the user everyday and restrict the user from using other apps opened at the same time and if he still uses other apps he would hv to wither the tree. � Otherwise, kudos to your team. You people are doing amazing. Loving it totally ❤️"

375,"I want to create a regular schedule and be able to amend times for regular activities on the occasional week.  Unfortunately, when you amend the time once it changes your schedule completely.  EDIT - I appreciate the response and looked at the guide.   I don't want to have to create a whole new bespoke routine day if I am just amending the timing of one event.  Unfortunately, this is not flexible enough as this won't save me any time."
376,Almost in New York City
377, I did the same thing in NOLA
378,"Nice app! I just cannot work out what these random numbers are within the pieces of the pie... 35, 30, 7:35, 30, 8:35, 30, 8:35. it is clearly a countdown of some sort but bears no relevance to anything obvious. How can I remove these? UPDATE TO REPLY: Thank you, but I am seeing 7x this info around the pie and personally it serves little use. Can this function be disabled?"
379,_jtv WHAT! I was only gone for 30 minutes and you`re already showing boobage without me?
380,"_Henrie oh my god, yeah! that cake looks delish! i hope you shared it! haha."
381,This is a very well designed app. I especially love the ability to share lists with my wife and make comments back on forth on specific tasks.
382, it wouldnt let me vote yesterday  but i made up for it today. i really hope u win cause everyone knows u deserve it =D
383,Great app but voice quality sometimes poor
384,"Its sooooooooo not funny when I have to move from computer to computer to render and draw. Come on, Revit! AutoCAD was never this bad."
385,"it's better to have biweekly schedule. Im using this app to manage my to do list, unfortunately, it doesnt have every other week schedule or biweekly schedule. to be honest i have lot of things to do during that schedule because my oayout is every other week so i really need to have that kind of schedule. olease add that up. thank you."

399, Well what im working on isn`t QUITE ready to post about publicly (still beta testing) but its a cool new script I coded
400,"Starting days i can,t tell more but its effective"
401,"I was so pleased with the new Habit tracker as well as using a true Dark Mode. However, I don't agree with the Premium policy as I prefer to make a bigger one-time payment (such as when I bought Final Cut Pro X with Apple) instead of a small recurring subscription that makes me want to go back to Todoist. It's a damn shame as I liked TickTick so much I'm willing to pay for Premium. Unfortunately, the subscription policy is an easy deal breaker."
402,Why are some guys so stupid? They have no idea what to do with a good girl who actually cares about them..so sad

411,"Well,  I discovered I can`t swim.  I`m out.  Sorry"
412, hope ya sleepin well  guys still here
413, Yep.
414,"Nice app overall! It does what it promises. I have two issues with this. 1. The widget seem broken. Previously, when I click on the task and mark as complete. Now it takes me to the task management page and there is no way to mark that as complete from there. I have to open the app to do that. 2. There is no way to sort tasks based on date. As a user, when I open a task list, I should see all tasks that are coming up so I can plan accordingly . I have to manually do that when I mark as complete."
415,"Amazing app, it's helping me so much developing my discipline and have my to do list always on point, thanks ever so much guys!"

424,I don`t like my dress
425, i mean give. lol with a finger! then crash her car! lol jk. thats bad. just ignore her

428, you are adorable
429,my gawwddd ! 6 headshotss inna row? im on fyaaahhh!
430,"Deleted review accidentally. 1. I create habit type tasks: the ones that repeat regularly. I don't even dream to have a habit/statistical section, but THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO SKIP OR FAIL THE REPEATABLE TASK. Now I only can delete it, but is is not representative way. 2. There has to be a way to exclude a list from the ""all tasks"" list. For example I have list with books to read and films to watch. A lot of tasks, that look bad in the ""all tasks"" list, I loose real important ""no date"" tasks because of it. You redirect me to your uservoice, but according to it excluding list from ""all tasks"" list has been ""in roadmap"" for 2 years, don't think you really care and your uservoice makes any difference. I know that adding habit tracker might be a heavy feature, but failing the task, or skipping it? Hell no. As well as excluding lists feature, it's also an easy one. But two years? Meh. Just don't pretend you care, be straightforward, like, 'we won't do it in the nearest future, not in our plans'."
431,Up late with nothin 2 do.....
432,��
433,Playing 'The Simpsons Game' for Nitentdo DS Light *_*
434,IT DIDN`T WORK

438,"Just Saw Confessions Of A Shopoholic...Totally fell in love with Hugh Dancy`s accent!! :3 Need $20.00 for tomorrow, new top i want!!"
439,"Decent app, very helpful to split things up visually but several issues over the past few months of usage. Tasks suddenly stop syncing up from a desktop PC to the app, deletion of lists seem to work but then the lists re-appear, and most recently all the tasks that have been completed over a period of time are suddenly back in my list. On a basic level, this app is useful, for anything more than that it's not the solution I was hoping for. I am a little OCD but if you are too then look elsewhere"

447, - I enjoyed seeing EVERYONE that presented on Saturday at the Clark Howard event - Especially the 3 pre-clark speakers
448,"Listen, this is a great tool. Take the time to learn how to use it. It will do great things for you. If you are like me and value your time, productivity, and efficiency... Use this app. As an android user, I keep my agenda view along with all my tasks and lists as a widget to the left of my home screen. I keep my calendar view to the right. Quick, clean, efficient."
449,Unfortunately i can not sign up or sign in. By google account or email. I tried a lot. From iran
450,"From the terrible Microsoft design to the fact of missing crucial features, especially in comparison to Wunderlist, and the fact that Microsoft only bought Wunderlist to shut it down... This piece of software actually had to overwhelm people to overcome the unfriendly Microsoft strategy, but here we are, letting us all down. Go to ticktick or smth else. Microsoft does not deserve our attention on this one :("

454,I've used this app multiple times over the years. It helps me stay away from my phone so that I can get tasks done. My love for a virtual tree far out weighs my urges to check social media and my blog. My grades in college and the cleanliness of my home thanks this app.
455,_123 i cant sleep
456,"The app is excellent in it's working. However, it crashes frequently, making me uninstall and reinstall it. Typically I think it happens if I open the app after a few days, without closing it properly ( forcing it to go in the background)."

460,"Overnight events (ie 8pm-4am) show up as All Day events in the calendar. If they are repeating, then two All Day events are shown.  Need to fix this ASAP!"
461,"The sorting option is not good. There's no option to manually arrange individual tasks. When you show completed tasks, it all over the place. Completed tasks should be grouped together and displayed at the bottom of the list after the incomplete tasks. It becomes very messy when completed and incomplete tasks are mixed together. Why tweak the app to make it worse than what it was before? Tweaking should making it better not worse."
462,yeah so Prom Night is now the Craft (good movie)
463, arrr bummer  who do you want to win?
464,"I`m bored, extremely bored. in the car. waiting for my dad. and dinner. chinese. yummm."

484,I cant watch anythgin till tonight
485,Generally very good. I have a few problems when I use it for reminders. working out what I need to write for a week of reminders in 10 days time is a bit challenging.

498,my tummy hurts!
499,"Fam this app is fire, no cost ease of use and fun to track progress!!!"
500,"It is not very flexible. It's a pain to make sub lists and quickly edit them. I wish when the app opened you see a list of all of your major tasks or a calendar. If these things are possible, maybe adding a tutorial feature when the app first downloads and opens would help streamline the experience."
501,"Star Wars day? I didn`t know there was a such thing  May the force, be with you <3"
502,"Good design, simple and clear but with the option to dig down for more details. However, they don't respond to emails and haven't released an update in over a year. Seems like this project was abandoned."

513,Hates headaches! Maybe I`m not ready to rock
514,"This app is fine in concept, but the ""game"" part of Habitica, arguably the reason you would use this app over other habit tracking apps, is just too boring and not that ""gamey"" to me, which doesn't keep me motivated to keep going back to the app for my habits. Concept is good, execution leaves much to be desired."
515,_boo jealous  can you add `and I really wish nicole was here..but we all know what she`s really doing` to that tweet?

535,"I love Habitica and I like the UI of the updated app, but I find it frustrating that the app doesn't show all the content that the website does. Normally this is just a small annoyance--but now, after paying for a Group plan for my family, I'm discovering that my kids can't access the group tasks list via the app! Which makes the entire thing a waste of money since the whole point was to be able to create tasks for family chores. Please tell me a fix is in the works!"
536,Out for ultimate training. looking forward to the sunset!
537, Yep: http://bit.ly/15yyId  We go there for Christmas treats!

541, yup then we are a day older
542,"It is such a great app to help you manage your time! I really like the fact that it can set the reminder time in a very specific way, it is perfect for people who have a different schedule everyday. One thing to point out will be the choice of the habit. Although you can type it yourself, wont really affect anything, I would like to have more type of habit to choose except for clicking ""other"". Also, it is sad that you need to pay for back up, but it is understandable."
543,"Purchased the full version which did nothing. Opted for a 24 hour face, again nothing. Tried to add additional events in upcoming days, did not show up at all."

545,App crashes
546,I don`t wanna work tonight
547,"This is by far the best to do list app I've come by. It has rich features and a great interface, even in the free version. It knows the difference between a task, and a habit. My main issue here with the app, is premium pricing. Why exactly do I have to pay a monthly fee for features that can be used offline? Normally, a monthly subscription is to support features that need to be consistently paid for. From what I can see, there's only one. If a one time payment option is added, I'll buy it."
548,im such a sucker for great cottys

616,"It's a great app. You can search for words in tasks. The reminders show up on my new Samsung S10, which is why I had to ditch Keep. To get five stars, I would like to see an easy way to access the app on my desktop. It would be great if it would work with Google calendar."
617, No mine looks the same.

629," Okay, cool. Hope you had better dreams than you had last week."
630,This app has most features for a free habit tracker and even the onetime payment is the cheapest in this category. The habit tracker of choice.
631,some advice for all of you: dont pressure wash your foot. it hurts and is not worth it. you really do want the skin on your foot. FYI. ow
632,"Please at least put an option to use the previous theme. I like the previous one with flat design (minimalist). If you could also put a feature to have other place a comment on our list, that would be great. Kindly prioritize the option to use the minimalist/flat design theme... It is less distracting which makes me more productive. I recommended this to my friends because of its design... good thing my other device is not set to auto update.. i was able to retain the previous version..."
633, Like you`re not enjoying the hell out if it.
634,"This app is great! Love how it harnesses events,task, and notes all in one simple interface! I would love to see a Google chrome version! Wouldn't suggest changing much, it would just be more convenient to plan everything out using a desktop or laptop rather than using a phone or tablet. Also, the widget functions need some improvement. If possible it would be nice to see a daily widget with events tasks and notes for the day. Overall really like the app!"
635,#thingsmummysaid  You are the result of a broken condom.
636, how about a new article on finding your YouTube channel stats in your Google Analytics account? Can`t find it
637,I'm giving this app 3 out 5 because there is a really annoying behaviour when you're adding a quick note and if you by mistake tap outside the text box (which one would do on the go) your note is erased and you need to start again. I'm considering uninstalling it because this happens almost every time I add a note which means that it takes me twice the time. Please at least keep the text and don't erase it in case of an accidental tap outside the box. Thanks

688,hi i have been using this app for a number of years right from the first business calendar app; the best feature i like is the management of reminders where the reminders stay on even after the event end time till is dismissed manually. however since i have upgraded to S10 the reminders are automatically removed after the end time. no change in settings has made any difference. unfortunately queries to the support team hasn't helped. such a shame update- switched to aCalendar app which works

So most of it works similar to Wunderlist which is good, but there's little things I just don't like. For example, when tapping on a list. Boxes are too BIG and in your face, text too big also. Main screen is ok. When ticking something off on a list how about something to divide to do and done from that list instead of everything together. Give us more customisation options for sizes, colours etc"

705,"Hey, guys! This is good idea! However, I have a feedback for you: Several times I accidentally was clicking task more than once, so I was increasing my level. I didn't found related settings. I think you should make task clickable (checkable, do you get me?) )only once per day, and highlight the finished tasks. This features will prevent accidental checking, therefore increasing level incorrectly. Could you explain me how to use such features, if you already have them??"

I purchased business calendar because of its outlook calendar sync feature, however the calendar requires an existing outlook account on the phone. I wanted a standalone outlook connector - One calendar app does a fine job there, this one fails. I asked for a refund the same day, and sent follow up emails too, but thus far no response. Useless support, don't deserve stars."

Always has, and I don't mind, because *something* has to pay for app development. But these new full page, video that can't be shut down, in your face for many seconds ads are new and intolerable.

Considering the benefits & satisfaction of completing tasks without missing them, the paid subscription is more than justified. Thank you!"
789,   .ï¿½ï¿½?????ï¿½ï¿½.  i bet. man i wish i coulda went some whr. i didn`t even go out here. i was home all weekend.  nyt life sux here
790, any chance of seeing you at a race in germany? unfortunately hardly any tv & news coverage of cycling here anymore!
791, ha... I thought you would enjoy the Family Guy reference... and I`m more bored than you
792,"This app has a nice interface and a great idea, but it seems to suffer the same issue I've found of all habit trackers. I can't easily keep track of multiple daily iterations of a habit. If I want to create a habit of say drinking 5 bottles of water a day, I want to be able to check off and keep track of each bottle drunk, then get rewarded when I finish all five. Most of the habits I want to develop fall in this category. Could this be implemented in the future?"
793, i thought you would win!  Fabulously40 have some bots on her side?
794,Happy Mothers Day to all Mom`s
795,"I have myself barely 4 hrs of sleep and the Lord blessed me with what feels like 8, but it came with a sore throat  pumpin out this paper!"

797,I have not been this sick in years. OMG. This sucks so bad. Sickness ended up including a full restroom cleanup.
798,"Awesome to do list, makes things like grocerie lists very simple the way list can be compiled as a page of single swipeable tabs."
799," Even more so bc I drove their asses to Chandler, which is why I am just now getting home, an hour and a half later. LOL"
800,Can't post to my google calendar or any other subscribed calendars. Disappointed because this app has promise.
801,"In this last update there is a bug: in a widget I enter the event, and then I press the top left corner arrow to go into the main app - it just exits. UPDATE: The latest update doesn't fix this"
802, its not just you - its properly dragged this week

807,"  Yeah, I only drank a little bit anyways. It definitely was the show and not the drink!!"
808,"it`s raining here  i`m stuck inside working today so i`d probably be peed off if it was sunny outside, i`m now ok with the rain"
809,will just take a bath
810, hahahaha definitely!  still writing?
811,Good Cool
812,"Ps Brian just announced his message title, 'what is in you will flow from you' My friend replied 'cheescake??' Ha!"
813,"I don`t think that im feeling too well. all the sudden, im tired but scared to fall asleep cuz I know I will wake up sick."
814,"ugh, not sure i have the patience or remaining intelligence at this point in the day (week?) to refactor and rewrite this package of code"
815,finally finished my marketing project only took me 7 hours..now just hanging out and relaxing
816,It`s after midnight & I hear the shower calling me- Technically it`s not twice in one day since it`s morning-- I`m not very 'green'.
817,trying to plan a huge birthday party by myself
818," *laughs* reading?!  not happening!  i`m glad alice was in the shower, she should`ve seen that we were going to be worried"
819,Twitter has spoiled all the fun. Frustratingly slow!!  couldnt even bid properly!
820," Toooooom! Do a tour in the Philippines, pleeease?  I`m risking my health to get your reply. Haha!"
821,With my jordie for a little bit
822,"Great, maybe best app for daily routine and habbits. Please, add repeating tasks."
823,It's just a skin for Google calendar.
824,"This app requires users to create an account with either FB or Gmail to use it, then you find yourself in a 7 day free trial in order to pay later. Not encouraging to even try it. At least inform users that's it's not free before asking access to their FB or Gmail accounts."
825,about to go to leeds shopping
826,so bored...
827,Very easy to use and very useful - thanks.
828,loving Mondays for so many reasons!

835,back to br
836,wow tiz almost midnite o_O bedtime for me!! ha gnite gorgeous ppl  *HADtheBESTdayEVER*
837,Loving this app so far. My only concern is that it does not highlight the current date on the calender when I open the app if there are no tasks/events for that day. This can be confusing. Another concern is that the calender does not indicate whether there are tasks/events for particular days by showing tiny dots next to the date.
838,Had a fun late night talk with   Good night world.
839,"so im drawing pictures to show how much i miss him. can anyone blame me, hes 4 hours away frm me"
840,Lousy app
841, i want to gooo
842,Would have been nice to explore more features without having to go pro right out of the gate. I'm not down to pay for something that supposedly works without trying it for myself. Could have easily enabled more options that entices the user other than the bare bones vs. I'll stick with Google for the time being
843,"oy, im such a nerd..im writin 2 no1 cuz no1 is followin me  i mean lik sum1 was but their account was deleted due to 'strange activities'"
844,Have difficulty trying to set multiple appts for the same time on different days... Too complicated! Just want to input what days of the week i want the appt for.
845," Thanks!  Unfortunately the EU had probs with his satellite provider, so even though his TV LOOKS great, it`s basically useless"
846,"Love that you can have multiple lists and also that you can reorganize the items on your list. When you complete an item, you can either check it off with an automatic date stamp or swipe it off completely �. This app has a very easy learning curve and I'm sure it probably has even more cool things that I have not discovered yet!"
847,"i feel like i`m quarantined everywhere i go... pinkeye, go away already!"
848,I love it
849,"Oh, **** me. I`ve just returned from the Supermarket Of Doom to find that I have nothing to drink here."
850,"I didn`t get the job at Stuff Magazine  Dammit, that would have been amazing!! Oh well."
851," the new series of the hills was on yesterday in uk , it was amazing! you looked really pretty on your birthday too."
852,"I liked the app notifications when they worked, gotta pay 2.99 a month? Crazy....mbe a year? Not a month for a calendar app. Most widget features wont work unless u pay, never got to see if they even were worth 299 a month....i like the popup reminders, hopefully someome will make a free one."
853,"Good app overall but still doesn't recognise the date of reminder from plain text, this needs to Improve"
854,Morning all! Have a GREAT DAY! Off to school I go
855,im just up :-| and its 12:43 :O  im so lazy thank god its a bank holiday
856,happy star wars day everyone  off to celebrate with the family... ok we`re not celebrating it but i am going round to the famo`s...
857,So far it's everything I need & was looking for.
858,"28 Oct 2018: same problem. Repeating tasks do not update and advance to next due date when completed. Checks it as done and then unchecks sometime at night with previous due date. 27 Oct 2018: After hearing back from the author, giving it another shot. Put two repeating tasks on it. See how it goes. 27 Oct 2018: This app didn't work as well for me. It would regularly uncheck tasks I'd completed or check tasks I'd not completed. The repeating task function didn't work well either."
859,my data is now disappearing frequently or often is suddenly double or triple in my calendar
860,Reminders should be available for all.
861, FUZE was giving away capes at Komen`s Race for the Cure today! And I`d always love a hug from you hun!

869," It would be great if those VIPS were for some acts I`d enjoy seeing, but noooo."
870,"When group-planting only host's timer starts. Asked friends to purchase the app, however each time we try to plant together and start the timer, only host's countdown begins. The other people in the room get stuck on ""waiting for the host to start..."" message."
871,"I'm a breath away from uninstalling this app again. Half the time it doesn't even do what it's supposed to do, some things it doesn't even let you do inside the app, you have to go to the actual browser version to do it. On that subject, the mobile browser is beyond awkward, no chance of navigating it properly! If I'm supposed to log into an actual PC just to check off that I did a workout or washed dishes, forget it. Right now the only reward I get is having my good mood ruined; certainly not worth it."
872,Great easy works fine no problems
873,"omg! taylor and selena broke up  sooo sad, aw i think i actually like selena now. poor gal."
874,Finally i have finished my tec recipe card and i feel somewhat accomplished

891, no one ever gave me the info I`m sad
892,"Really awesome app, it helps my team and I go through all our important chores on the date and time we need it. The notifications about changes and new chores also really helps because you know exactly when something changes."
893,"  Yeah, I posted it in the news blog yesterday."
894,Im sad right now becuz of my lady

900,"This is a fantastic app with a fantastic community-- love this game :) Helped me start sleeping on time and drink water-- anything that you can imagine for yourself, it can help you do!"
901,"I LOVE IT! This app us so simple and easy to use, it's so clear to see what needs to be done. I love how you can carry tasks over from one day to another or carry over tasks from over lists. I also love how you can add steps to a task and set a due date. I LOVE IT :)"
902,Managed to find a bottle of Pimm`s! If only we had the weather to go with it
903,http://wave.google.com/ <3 Google ... wish they`d spend a bit more time adding bits to Chrome though
904,"Not bad but not great. Pros: 3rd party calendar sync, time line view, icons & colour options to customise. Cons: can't sync devices, no task list or tick box. More options needed such as daily time line view, font size & highlight current day. Editing isn't easy & I think the whole app including widget could have a neater, tidier look. Overall it's not very intuitive, needs more options & flexibity. It has some way to go. I've got premium btw."
905,no class the next two days...but work  everyday from today til next wednesday  so sad
906, It was on March 22nd in UK..today all quiet here regarding mothers day  Very sweet of u to wish though..thanks!
907,actually did progressive studying today..
908,I have to start eating healthy
909," well, my question is on your blog post"
910,my 3yo just woke and groggily walked over to my office.  Is now sleeping in my lap
911,http://twitpic.com/66xjl - An hour in the sun turned me into a blancmange. Sucks to be pale
912,With the short period of time I've used this app I have enjoyed it. The app has been a great tool to help my keep track of my 2018 goals and stay on top of new habits I am trying to create to better myself and future. it has a clean UI although i wish it had more theme options. This app has been great at motivation on days o have slacked off or days I messed up with its visual aid on my progress for 2019. I would recommend it to someone trying to create a better habits.
913,not letting anyone get me down  tired of taking on other people`s pain all the time! I am a happy person with or without drama... om.....!
914," Patience, it`s worth it"
915,You can`t spell #melo without e m and o...  <3 to my favorite blogging site.
916,"I really like the concept, but the app/widget doesn't recognise 'reminders', only 'events'. If my day was organised hour by hour with events then this would be ideal, but I rarely have more than 2 events per half day. Reminders I use all the time, if the widget recognised those then it would be far more useful to me. Would still recommend despite this."
917,"Updated: It's widget can switch between calander / todolist and view the events for the calander, in the widget when clicking instead of it opening the calander app like most apps. It's task list doesn't seem to sync to gtasks but the calander does. Upgrade to premium to add things like a recurring event, daily planner, WhatsApp reminders, extra colors etc."
918,Need some coffee... Getting serious withdrawal symptoms
919,Don't use this unless you sync your tasks. The backup and restore functionality from one device to the next is bad.
920,A recent update broke existing home screen widgets. It also made it impossible to create thin widgets - the minimum width is now 4 units which basically takes up the whole screen.
921,"Hi can I have an OPTION TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE NEW AND OLD DESIGNS OF THE WIDGET? The previous version was able to have larger boxes to fit long description tasks, while the new one just puts three dots and shortens the task descriptions to fit in one fixed width, which disables full reading of the task(bad). Also, subtasks cannot be seen WITHOUT CLICKING the main task, which kinda defeats the purpose(again) of having a todoist widget where i should be seeing the overview of everything. Thanks"
922," hmm, okayy, im really sorry to hear about it  why do you thikn she would have done that? :S"
923,Omg! My dad called me a johny come lately haha because I`m slow  haha
924,"I couldn't register , the circle rounds and rounds .. And nothing happens"
925,"Omg just what I've been looking for and you can also have it on a desk top so whenever I'm working and can't reach my phone for booking clients this comes in handy, can't wait to see what is coming soon �� Edit: I went on the computer to see if there is a major difference and OMG there is I totally love the desktop site I cannot wait for more features to come I totally recommend this app to anyone��� so in love"
926,****. I got a math test today.
927," Thanks, none close to me."
928,I really like this app and ised to love it until there was an update that was stopping me from using it without upgrading. If i had to pay a one time purchase thats one thing but an annual fee?? Give me a break. $5 for a planner app is reasonable if you use it all of the time but not every year. Yall are greedy.
929,I don't see where you can use voice to make tasks??
930,I don`t think I am going to get to see any of the sun today  gutted I NEED COLOUR!
931,it was alright in the beginning but search bar disappeared after adding my tasks. guess there is bug who can't handle long task list. not recommending.
932, that gets around the problem I had of doing it all myself  good idea.
933," Yes, and I really hoped to do one last gas price story... but I guess it wasn`t meant to be!!!"
934,":( i cant log in after because i need to add a username. i did it, but the app froze when i was adding my username and now it seems is taken... when it wasn't. i tried again with a different one and happened again :("
935,"A subscription for an App that simple? Are you insane? It should be a one time payment no more, around 3-4$. This is my advice to you, you won't last long with this kind of strategy..."

952,"I like this app. Always wanted a planner. Only problem is when I try to click on the tabs on the side its very sensitive. Takes me forever to click it, it disappears."
953,"could be better. pls fix the 'repeat' setting where i could accually pick the exact date and time. for example i have to study during mondays, tuesdays and fridays at 8 pm. the app isn't very specific about it deeming it useless to me. hoping for a better update."
954,Ha ha 1 point for the men
955, OMG!! that is tragic!
956," i`m still awake, coulnd`t go back to sleep"

972, Hope you feel better! If your alone we can talk until your ready to go to bed...I`m alone too
973,"Easy to use. Love that the % automatically updates. Free version only has 5 trackers, but honestly it's hard to focus on more than that."
974,"Loved the concept, beautiful design, and has taken its place on my home screen after a clarification from the Dev on syncing other calendars.  I also love the fact that you can just jump in and use the widget, or you can opt for deep customisation of the look, feel and functionality."
975,i feel like watching a disney movie...too bad we dont have a vcr anymore
976,"Like the concept, but was hoping to see the full widget on my phone. Unfortunately does not display like the screenshot you show above on a samsung s7 edge (not sure if it is settings i need to change). I would also like better integration with microsoft outlook. Currently it takes me to the calendar but none of my meetings show up on the widget. Integrates well to samsung planner and google calendar but not my work app calendar. Finally like some of the ideas below of changing to a 24h calendar."
977,The battle at Minas Tirith is still very impressive. Return of the Jedi is the best Lord of the Rings movie IMO.

986,I deleted the app but it is still charging my PayPal account. No one is responding to my messages at customer service. Please stop charging my account.

989,"Mobile phone check-in? Another fail! American`s service came close, but crashed at the gate. I`m now 0 for 3."
990,This app has helped me greatly in getting organized and managing my life. I like that it intergrates with my calendar and email. Great productivity and goal app.
991, Yups!  I still have a lot of pruning of unfollowers to do. It takes  time
992,"Each of the features acts like it should. Only two things kept this from five stars: 1 - the reminder is set by default to 15 min and there is no easy way to turn that off or set it to another time. 2 - the events are colorless, making them less at-a-glance for looking up your plans for the day. Other than those two things, I've got no complaints."

997,I just paid for premium as I was told by the app developers that it would enable me to sync my data from my old android phone onto my new android phone. But it fails everytime I click 'sync'. I sent the developers my feedback but they won't get back to me.
998, looks same in Noida too
999,1 more day!
1000,Very well polished minimalist.

1006,honestly i cannot figure this twitter thing out
1007,"It used to be a slick, minimal app that did what it needed to. Then they kept adding layers of unneeded features and forced people to make an account just to use it. No thanks."

1028,Happy May Bank Holiday British Peeps
1029,"Its a good idea, but an app like this shouldn't lock a whitelist behind a paywall. I've already read the responses from the devs on the other reviews so I understand why it is but that doesn't change my review. I listen to music and use flashcard apps/dictionary apps/art references and my gallery on my phone when doing what I needed this app for. It's useless if it lacks that basic functionality. Will not pay for something that should be included in the free version."

Unlike other apps that distract you with details, blog posts, etc (I'm looking at you, myfitnesspal), I can easily track my habits in seconds without going down the internet rabbit hole **edited to add that I'm still using it weeks later. Very simple. Although I started off ambitious and added many habits, I ended up following the developers suggestion and paring back to two key habits. I'll add more after these stick"

Literally 1 every few minutes for hours and I have no clue how to stop this without him just unsubscribing. Given that sharing is a big part of why I wanted the app, it does put a damper on things for me."

1160,"It's ok. There's no actual options to make a list. I have to number each 
item (task, action, etc) myself & in paragraph form. There's no proper list 
formatting in there. Besides that, it's alright. Not what I had hoped :("
1161,Awful graphics. Idea ia great but the graphics need a major update. Can't tell the different between anything in this game. Overall disappointed.
1162,"I like this app very much, because it's fairly easy to use and it allows for actual ring tones to be used; not just notification tones). However, my biggest issues are that I cannot receive any notifications from the planner if the event was created on my phone's calendar (I'm assuming this is the issue since only half, or less than half, of my total events and tasks do not sound). It also will not sound when I have reminders set for many different times. It's original default reminder is 15 minutes before the event time, but I changed it to be on time and then I would make other reminders if need be. It will only sound at 15 minutes before the event time, no matter what I tell it to do."
1163, another letter for you - this one car insurance - ouch

1184,"Actually a great app, I'm migrating from Wunderlist, and I love the option to add tasks from other lists to ""My Day"" and focus on just those. The 3 stars are from glitches that I'm experiencing, that just make it troublesome for smooth working. First is the ""from today"" tray that keeps coming up endlessly, needing me to force quit the app, only to have it happen repeatedly. Secondly the widget that doesn't update either tasks I've added, or tasks I've marked as completed in the app."

However, since the latest update my app constantly says ""unable to sync"" even though it appears to be working when I check in the browser on my desktop.

So please add feature so we can see all our completed tasks upto a month . So we can see our records and edit any possible mistakes. Thank you. Other than this small part This app is best for me. I am requesting you if you can listen us please please add this feature. ��� COMPLETED TASKS LIST UPTO A MONTH
1286,is listening to Jello Biafra at work.
1287,"Good design, but it's not exactly free if you have to pay for basic features, like reoccurring events."
1288," My #followillfriday sucks because while I was teaching people how to be nice, you **** were drooling over Notion"
1289,"It could be absolutely great... Except my widget is blank when it shouldn't be and my notifications don't work. However, I love this app and think a lot of hard work went into it"
1290,"I wish widget would have a very compact design, just a list of tasks, nothing more -- no menu bar, no headers, etc. As for me, the widget eats too much of homescreen space and is not optimised."
1291,on the way to nanny  school starts tomorrow! one step closer to being a teacher!
1292,"I like the ease of creating different to do lists, ability to create subtasks, and that i can make my grocery shopping list according to what store I shop at. It's great that the grocery list are automatically sorted by aisle for you. However, i noticed that if i add a price to the beginning or end of the grocery item, that it gets put in the 'other' aisle category. I also like how you can switch something in one list to a different one just by tapping on it. Nice work �"
1293,"Be very careful. This syncs with your tasks in Outlook. At first that sounds great, until you find out that if you use any feature of Outlook that isn't in this app (regenerating tasks after completion for example), your tasks are OVERWRITTEN in Outlook with ones compatible with this app, resulting in loss of things like due dates. I lost all my regenerating tasks, replaced by occurring tasks instead, causing so many items to be late. If you use any kind of advanced Outlook tasks, don't use."
1294,okay really really bored. i watched a michael jackson concert from 1992. he`s awesome  and his short films r coolio too (:
1295,couldn't exactly figure out how to use it
1296,"I need to track not only good habits, but also bad. With this app it is impossible. I don't want to smoke AT LEAST two times in a month or greater to reach my goal, I want to smoke NO MORE THEN two times in a month or less for success"

1300,*sigh* joe sings so purdy.  he makes me feel better
1301,"This is my first time rating this app because I noticed that there were changes in putting a reminder. Hopefully after the task tab, the time & date will be under it. It's a bit hassle that it was made smaller that without my glasses I didn't notice it for several times. Also,I don't see any purpose of sharing it to other people ;so it should not be the priority. I hope that you can do something about this. Anyway, thank you for helping me get through my daily tasks.I'll wait for another update"
1302, Ok then have a good day
1303, - thank you - I take that as a compliment if I may -

1321,"Good app, but not exactly what I was looking for. This app uses your calendar events and organizes them in the circle. The controls are great, I love when I move the red time bar it scrolls through all the things and shows the time changing. Love the widget. I wanted this to work out a homeschool schedule. I ended up having to make a new calendar and syncing only that one. I was able to change the colors of each event in the app. Very easy to use overall."
1322, So you`re gonna make me go alllll the way to the store??? LOL  I have to find one...I`ll Google.  Thanks.    LOL

1359,"The app is good.. But we can overide this by changing the system time manually to future.. Ideally after turning on the time the app shouldn't hv allowed to change the screen, even to home screen or settings screen.. Then this could have been perfect. But android system may not allow to do so.."

1389, nice new profile picture! Glad to see some friends in there
1390,"Great at first but now it's getting on my nerves. I tried to create a routine for each day of the week. Today is Monday, and for some reason, my Monday routine shows up for tomorrow, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. I've had daily routines show up on other days over the past week as well. There seems to be a setting where I can change this, but that doesn't seem to do the trick. It shouldn't be this hard to have one daily routine for each day of the week. Uninstalled."

1427,"a little confusing at first, but it transfers your calendar and alarms to the app. one bad part is it adds everything on your calendar. like if you add ""eat breakfast"" it'll go on your calendar. so that's only a little annoying since my calendar needs to be clear and easy to read. but besides that. it works well"

1442,Like all the other users of Wunderlist i had no choice but to switch. It took time to figure out how to be able to create lists without having to have due dates & reminders-shut them off in settings. I already had a Microsoft account which I used to sign into Wunderlist so I used it to automatically sign into To Do. That made it easy to import the Wunderlist lists to To Do {pop up at bottom}. I panicked at first but I was able to figure out how to use To Do in about an hour after installing it

1451,It's very simple to use. I like that you can set as either a yes/no habit or a rep like two times a day. My only hangup would be that the free version only allows tracking for five habits but that can be a bonus if your just getting started. You don't want to overwhelm yourself.

1488,"_hong  Oh yeah, just came back from a weekend of cosplay photo marathons"
1489,Not happy
1490,"It seems like the developer is paying attention to customers, which is a good thing. Hopefully they'll respond to the overwhelmingly critical reviews of the most recent update. The checkboxes simply make it too easy to accidentally mark a task as complete. This is a bad, bad deal. I use Todoist to help me more efficiently run my businesses. If I errantly check off a task, it could cost me a lot of money, and possibly lose me a client. Hopefully you'll fix this right away."
1491,"Very easy to pull me in I should have stopped, but hindsight is always 20/20. My friends and people who are interested in Google Apps for integrated coordination of tasks, meetings, whatever, but what really gets my blood boiling and made me downgraded from 3 stars to 2 Stars is the deadweight loss of not being able to either donate the rest of the subscription Source Capital investment that is just raining still if someone makes to make a donation. Is that I'm still sitting here with this deadweight loss."
1492,It`s not now... Nor has it ever been Weigly North!! Have avoid drive home!!

1503,"Firstly, thanks for your quick responses back. I appreciate it. Ok, so can you explain how to do it and where that is on the app? Because there's no tutorial for that part. When I click on the other tabs that show the month stats and graph there's nothing indicating that the old schedule has been saved in an independent track and a new track created."
1504,"I really enjoy this app! The design is very simple and well put together. The cute designs of people enjoying their day when I finish tasks is almost rewarding, and it's nice when the app tells me to enjoy my day off when I have no tasks. I like that I can color-code things and add subtasks, as well as create different priority levels for tasks. The only thing I wish it had was a monthly view. Then I would give it 5 stars."
1505, hey you weirdo! haha jk! I love you!
1506, haha nice to know I`m not alone! Working in the BBC and can`t see it

1514, nice recolouring of your page  nobody is buying your anti-twittering words!! YOU LOVE IT!!!!
1515,"Has every feature I could ask for in an app like this, and it's all executed perfectly. Leagues better than any of the other options. I do feel like $30 a year is steep for premium, though. For new users, know that premium is by no means necessary; It just gives you a little more capacity for random operations and unlocks some convenient functionality."

1544,"Started using this about a year ago and it quickly became a fixture on my home screen. It functions about as you would expect out of the box, which is nice because navigating the customization leaves a little to be desired."
1545,at last i wr0te again....got bored the previous dayss....
1546,my mobile is getting switched off after installing.it worked fine on 1st day of installing. please fix it
1547,i need a good idea... FAST!
1548,Cannot drag and drop the task. too bad.
1549,"The team fixed importing bookmarked tasks from Wunderlist, since about a year ago. After using ToDo for couple days, I can say it's *almost* on par with Wunderlist. But, given that it's advertised as a replacement, developed by the same team, it's frustrating that not all behavior was backported. No quickly prioritizing tasks by toggling bookmark state, no list selection and delete. Hard to deal with duplicate lists after importing. Custom sorting, so you add a task via widget, but cannot see it"
1550, Have a great weekend Mononoke  I may be tweeting from inside the movie theater either Monday or Tuesday  lol
1551,"Broken! So far, not impressed. I bought this expecting multi-device sync and haven't seen it do that. It wouldn't even restore a backed up file after logging off then on."

1563,"Thanks for the tech support! The app wasn't working properly before, but now it runs fine. The only probkem is that when I press the home button, the tree doesn't die and the ambient sounds still play like the app is still open. But it's fine because the tree will die if I go into any another app."
1564,Laundry time and LOTS of it!
1565,Money hungry devs want about $5/mo for simple features... That's about $60/year for the fully functional organizer app. Other than that it seems nice so far.
1566, I will watch that at some point. Have it on hd but Stace also wants to see it in hd so waiting

1572, I had an account at a local comic store that I ran to 4k  at one time
1573,The reason I am giving this 1 star is because of its unreliability! I purchased this app for my android phone and my Mac desktop. It is very frustrating that the same app on my Mac IS NOT updating with my phone!!! This app is absolutely useless to me when I cannot see events that I have put in in real time even after I refreshing the app. Very disappointing! And kinda pissed off that I paid good money for this app!

1576,Not happy that when a new task is entered it goes to the bottom of the list instead of automatically to the top like it did in Wunderlist. It's crazy that you have to drag every entry to the top of your list.

Sometimes I forget where I filed my note or task (again longtime user) and then it takes me a while to go through all my files to figure out which title heading I put it under, but if it had a search feature I could quickly find it and get back to being productive. For this reason I gave it 4 stars because it has room for improvement."

The tasks are separated and I'm not sure I can see all of them at the same time.  I'd also like to know if it can sync between Android (Note 4) and iPad.

I was used to clicking 'today' and having everything there and in folders that needed to be done past and present. Now i have to choose what i do everyday! Also if i skip a task and want to reset it to today so it can repeat in 2 weeks it retains the day so repeats in less than two weeks. And the folders? What's the point in having folders if you can't sort by them in any list?Is there an alternative?

1773,NOTE TO SELF::: I did find an app that does not need my personal details in order to function. EDIT::: It is clear that the developers of this app have absolutely no idea what they're doing because their app DID request a password from me; a password I was not willing to give. I don't care that they are calling me a liar. I am not asking anybody anything - I am merely telling prospective clients what I experienced with this app and to be careful. There are more secure apps available out there.

1788,This app is great but one thing that bugs me is that it doesnt have the option to attach images to the tasks. You can comment images within a task but I just wish you could directly attach them so you could see it underneath a task rather than having to click on the task then go into comments.
1789, aww  cant wait till u get 2 Sydney ;D i missed out on tickets tho.. :O ****

I've had the app for a few weeks and I am still trying tweak my layout ... visuals are everything for me. I believe, when originally setting up a few weeks ago, I was a bit annoyed to have spent time choosing colors for the widget to find out it is a premium feature (To Developer: plz be upfront on the premium feature options). I think once I get it really working for me it will be a fave app."

1803, hhaha kewl dude!!  but if u dont know & he does have a reason well thats another story mhmhmh...does he?
1804,aww my friend just called and said that she got a better job so she won`t be working with me anymore
1805,Having trouble syncing my iphone to my work exchange email  help!!!!
1806, The rest of the week is less than 2.5 hours long
1807, Sure thing!
1808,How to name the tree that Ive plant?
1809,Having a light depression. Just payed an extra bill from last years taxes... Must find a country with a tax that is lower than 56%
1810," http://twitpic.com/2uzx4 - haha, his heads bigger than yours! awwwh, lol"
1811,  gutted i miss that! the one night i try 2 leave early  lol! friends visitin were tired haha!
1812,"The motivation pics stopped at some level and dont want to be changed, pls solve this issue"
1813,  And it`s only downhill from now until Labor Day!
1814,I've tried several of these kind of things and this seems the most versatile. It takes a while to get the hang of it and I'm still discovering aspects of the app that I didn't know where there. Most times I think something about the app is not good I am realising that I just didn't uncover the setting that fixes the issue yet!
1815," aha, so that`s you.  I`ve been meaning to take a look. Looks cool. If you could just get a pool in there"
1816, that sucks!  put some britney on!
1817, i was at the outlets too
1818,"oh happy day!!! nice weather, smiling, happy baby and icecream later"
1819,No Reminders in Free Version. How do you expect to compete with other ToDo apps if your Free Version is useless? SUBSCRIPTION MODELS SUCK.
1820,"Oh, yes... Happy NINE year annivarsary to Hanson`s second studio album, 'This Time Around.'"
1821, ummm.. sure! i miss ya`ll alot too.  i think you know who i meant.
1822,"Very customizable planner, easy to navigate, but not basic. I love it. Thanks to the creators, you guys really did a nice job."
1823,"Very cool app. Using it for real life stuff as if it's a video game is so fun. Could have some bug tweaks and possibly an overhaul for the interface, but it's still close to perfect and runs great."
1824,Super app. One of features to add to basic version is type of calendar task distribution to visualise your week/month/year.
1825,"finally gave twitter a try, will find out why is it sooo popular ... hope i wont be too hooked"
1826,The full screen ads are intrusive and seriously hinder the free version's usability. Before the ads this was a very solid and handy calendar app.
1827,"good except notifications also vibrate, and there's no way to disable vibrations for this app!"
1828,Helpful in making list of work
1829, probably not. I hate when that happens!
1830,"Great app! But have a few suggestions that would make it the best app in the market! Trust me people are looking for this! 1) The ability to add your schedule with a few clicks. For example you can set reoccuring events, but peoples schedules alternate. Would be great to be able to click the days you work group then at the same time and categorize them under work. (For reference look at the nursegrid app) 2) add your spouse or family directly. So everything is synced real time.(familywall)"
1831,"Just uninstalled it It looks a great app, but one its fundamental features (reminder) was available only in premium mode."
1832,sizzling outside. Work inside = double
1833, Nice! You should submit that to failblog.org
1834,"The best to-do and calendar combined app I have come across, and worth the fee. Have looked at many on Android and iOS, and this is the only one that does what I want."
1835,"Definitely not worth downloading. The app keeps crashing. Does not record the time focused properly and hinders with functioning of the other apps. No point in buying the premium version either, a total waste of money. Latest update is just not upto the mark. Customizing anything usually results in the app crashing."
1836,Please tell me how to use the app
1837,and we`re in
1838, can`t you write a song without your guitar? i thought you could  look for something to do!
1839,Great way to visualize daily schedule in a more intuitive way
1840,"....ok, sOooooooooo I DID that!! i`ve got u in the palm of my hand"
1841,"Just watched the trailer for the new Sam Raimi movie, Drag me to Hell.  Looks interesting, but there was no humor in it."
1842,"This app would be fantastic if the calendar integration also picked up repeating events in my google calendar, but it doesn't. I need to see all that's on my calendar in order to properly plan. After the second repeated event, it shows a blank calendar day, which is inaccurate. This alone makes it just another to do list app without productivity functionality."
1843,"Happy Mother`s Day to all the amazing women who put up with us crazy, demanding children. Thank you.  Very very much."
1844," Hi! We get to try out new restos..so yea, it fuunn  Let`s have dinner when you get back!"
1845, yeah ill be on verizon... so those are my two options right now...
1846,I`m sooo hyper! And I don`t even know why! Hahahahaha!

1851,Birthday tomorrow. Doing jack **** all weekend
1852,Reminders are invisible
1853,"Recommended this by two work friends to help keep focused as we read long sometimes boring documents - works so great! I feel really motivated to keep reading and stay off my phone. Even for things the app doesn't track (like not chatting to co-workers) I feel more guilty/conscious of concentrating when the app is running and growing my tree, so I have cut down on chat with coworkers and stuff too."
1854,I just downloaded this.  The free version was definitely useful but I went ahead and got the paid version because I wanted to use the repetitive tasks and weekly planner as well.  I definitely think this will be worth the purchase.
1855,I hadn`t realised how Long it had been since I was last `tweeting`... Now I`m on here I don`t know what to say  x
1856,Hmmm. http://www.djhero.com/ is down

1861,I REALLY  should have gone to the Chiropractor this week . . And today  my neck hurts so bad

1879,It helps me stay focused. Wish you could allow certain apps that you need to use
1880,"Wow... A To Do list app without the option to make your tasks recurring. I won't lie, I am absolutely baffled that this is omitted. Maybe it's in the web version, or the iOS version, but I'll never know... You tick a date in the calendar and... Where is the tick box for 'repeat every xxx'? Maybe it's a premium feature, I guess I'll never know that either..."
1881, i can still read `em...

1888, Hehe! It is nice down there
1889,My phone is ultra fast now with all the latest firmware updates installed!
1890,"Up early this morning, first to portmeirion then home"
1891,This used to be a very good calendar app with plenty of good features in the free version already. Unfortunately they introduced intrusive full-screen ads recently to force you into buying the premium version. I'll rather switch to another calendar app than be blackmailed like that.
1892,: wait till the vacation ends! u shud be cycling a lot then!
1893,"Dad just said that our trip to UK is cancelled, due to da swine flu. Ooops! Sorry abang."
1894,"I've only just started using it and can already tell it has potential. It has a simple UI but very confusing features with next to no instruction on how the features work. I purchased the premium version with the hopes to organise my routines to suit my shift work. But I can't find a way to automatically alternate my routine cycles (if it's even possible), starting the following routine cycle when the previous ends"
1895,"Happy Friday Dance, no rain and I`m about outta here..till 2morrow  I sat the saturday morning shift, but its still all good"
1896, sounds like a great idea.  wish I could make it
1897, Me too!    need some tour dates stat!

1903,"Richelle Mead - Succubus Blues-fabulous read! very entertaining, lots of fun and interesting too!! next please.."
1904,"it is a very nice way to look at your schedule. It also helps you determine productivity, whether you are scheduling efficiently and are you allowing yourself some downtime. It can use some improvements and I believe that they will happen."
1905,"I just got a call from my chimp buddies, want to join the party. Loads to prepare now. Wow this is great. Cup of tea first i think. Erm"
1906,My brother is making banana shake. Yesterday he made mango shake. He`s our shake guy.

1913,"I just got the app, but I can barely use it because every time I click on something it redirects me to a page that asks me to upgrade for $4.99/yr. If it would just let me use the free version I might actually like it."
1914,"@ludajuice Lebron is a Beast, but I'm still cheering 4 the A..til the end."
1915,wide awake ready for the big shopping trip! hope I get tones of sweet dealz and lots of fancy clothes
1916,This is the 10th or 11th time that I installed this app after uninstalling as it keeps crashing all the time.. application is very helpful to focus on work/study except that it doesn't work properly. I am just fed up of reinstalling this app everytime.
1917,ItS pretty good.
1918,Wow... I was tricked into the #hoppusday hype today....
1919,"BEWARE the trial period is a scam I've been using the free version for a while and decided to try the premium for 7 days per the trial ad. After 5 days I realized it didn't quite organize my information how I best work so I wrote to cancel. They informed me that I must have accidentally signed up for a non trial and by their strict Terms cannot refund me. So I wrote back nicely that my intention was to try it per the Ad, but they said it's not possible. Really?"
1920,Restoring new iTouch 2.  Excited to use it. Yeeeeeeeee. Goodbye iTouch 1.
1921,"A decent app for its intents and purposes but I struggle to stay invested. It's visually good, great icons and colours, also has a nice selection of skills. My biggest issue is the navigation. I can't immediately see or twirl down to see subtasks. Actually marking something as done, especially subtasks is a challenge - mostly because you face to keep tapping through the task and pages of info to get there. Perhaps a mind map or something would make it easier."
1922, Thanks G! My actual birthday is on Tuesday and I will be 24.
1923,Watching the Killers on JR. They are awesome. Too late though. They just cut the programme mid song. Twas my favourite too.

1930,stupid HIP!! I hate you!! And I can`t even break in my new kicks!!!  GRRRR!
1931,"Looking good Todo manager. The premium was already expensive for India, but I just realized that not only they increased the price, but the price Indians pay would be more than the US price. Now, that's called a rip off."
1932," can`t.  wish I was sleeping. Gotta be at work in less than 4 hours... Wait, what`re u doing up???!"
1933,_n_booklife I heard about that too... that seems an overreaction...

1943,@_Emily_Young_ okey
1944,"It is doing a strange black screen thing, and randomly opens by itself (other reviews have mentioned this) and I suspect it is making my phone crash. My phone is crashing several times a day, when I remove the app it stops crashing. I hope there is a fix for this. It works just fine on my tablet, but not my phone. It's a great app due to its simplicity. I switched to another planner app today and will be requesting a refund."
1945,Seems like there is a bug when trying to sync my notes to my dropbox account. Would give you 5 stars if fixed.
1946, congratulations! woootwoooo!   great game!  nakaka-hyper kayo!
1947,Can't complete events. Must keep dismissing it or delete it.
1948,this app is great but i have a problem. the timeline after a while says this app has been blocked by your system and its gives two options. 1) troubleshoot and 2) Refresh background task. This ptoblem is occuring every time. The troubleshoot isnt helping me. I have a vivo phone. please help!!.
1949,I bought paid version. It works perfectly for me. Serves the purpose. Now I am able to manage my daily tasks with efficiency.

1961,"The app itself is great and I don't mind that there's a paid premium version. In fact I think that's a great idea, but I don't want to have to pay a subscription for a simple list app. I'd absolutely pay a generous one time price for it because the app is worth it, but I don't care for another subscription. I'll have to stick with the free version"

1965,"You can't set a location by name, only address. Yes I tried setting my location manually, like that would be at all useful. Do you even understand what I'm saying? I CANT TYPE IN LA FITNESS AND GET AN ADDRESS. It will just send me to whichever is closest. Setting my location wouldn't help, it would just send me to the closest one to my manual instead of one that may be further... Worthless."
1966,had an awesome time with  and 
1967,"Really love the app. Helps me organize my time and schedule. If you could just make the hours numbering in front of the sector, and adding an option for showing minute division lines would really help to read it better. Setting the hours numbering outside the clock makes it look kinda crowded, and with some of the hour numbers (12, 3, 6, 9) not shown kinda bothers me. Also please make a preview of the clock in the settings so we won't need to switch from the app to the homescreen to see the changes. Really looking forward to see these features fixed. Overall, great app!"

It looks like there is something wrong because I can arrange some lists and couldn't for others, and the starred list which is switched to important is just a long list, I liked how it was divided before, it is really disappointing."
2005,"I've had this app for years, even upgraded it to the premium version. Loved it.. then as the developers started updating, I started having many issues. Each time i used the app it would show in the premium or free version; it was inconsistent. I wrote the customer service for assistance and I didn't get any help. So i lived with it. Most recently, I started receiving ads after every entry; Not okay!! I sent another email 2 wks ago which they have not responded to; which is why I'm here. Help!"

Extremely helpful for users of all age groups; and with the Backup & Sync features you just can't go wrong with this app!"
2012, no problem.  i wasn`t really sure what i was doing.  it was some application on the twibe page.
2013,"The app's a bit glitch-y, not gonna lie, but it helps tremendously in my day-to-day life. The community aspect of it is amazing, I actually feel motivated by all the kind words. Good job, developers, my life's a bit less bleak now! c:"

2048,"I was keeping track of Christmas gifts by checking then off once they were purchased and looking back by selecting, ""show completed tasks"". Until today when I went to check and they are all deleted. Kind of a bummer.

2056,"It's user-friendly and can be personalised very efficiently, but I am currently having issues with it overlapping with the built-in Google calendar. It didn't use to. I keep that for personal use and this one for business, obviously. But now they both sync and show the same things, whichever calendar I select, so I cannot use them differently. I hope there is a way around this, otherwise I will have to download a replacement."

2074," sounds good, the one I was too was also fun"
2075,"Too many crashes over the past few months, especially in the widget"
2076,"The app is OK but it could be much better in terms of usability. For example: 1. When setting a new reminder, the first button (which you are most likely to press without thinking) should be 'set timer', not 'share the task'. More people will want to set a reminder than share a person note. 2. The 'focus' button when the reminder comes up is in the prime location for when you are typing/using your phone and leads to you accidentally cancelling reminders each time."

2103, you`re just unhappy to return to occupying the same city as me  I am cry now too.
2104,_cupcakes that busy wowsa .. okay my pizzas gonna be a while  sorry..
2105,Simple app that provides all I need to track habits. UI could use a refresher.
2106,"Works well. Does more than I need. A little awkward setting up reminders. 4/24/19 UPDATE: New app update forces me to read how long ago was the task due and then it shows what it is. Very very annoying. Will be looking for a new app if they don't fix this. 4/30/19 RESPONSE: Pop up notifications show how long was the task due, then what it is. And I mostly read pop up or slide down from the top. Disabling Countdown doesn't solve the problem."
2107,"installed, looked like what I was looking for, loved the design. but the app makes me use the standard alarms and calander of my phone to put every bit of planning in, and I HATE the calendar on my phone, thats why I came here... to bad"
2108,Great! It's a great game to motivate people to do big stuff who just keep sitting on the sofa and don't want to move.thank you creaters of habitica.��

For example the challenges in a guild is not displayed and the task detail in challenges are also not displayed. I mainly used the web version, but it would be great if there are not much differences between the website and this app!"

2197,"Was and is a great app. Used it for years, But now the fullscreen ads are an immediate turnoff. Small ads down the bottom were fine, but forcing me to sit through a full screen ad till the timer runs out is a HUGE NO for me.

2206,This application is very good. Feature rich and most powerful. Even though you should add few features in the app.   1- Repeat frequency should have hourly and 30 minutes  2- Add bullet points format in the notes section. Like Google keep have.  3- Provide database backup option with Google Drive and Dropbox.

2216,"Needs to give you the option of adding pictures when note taking. If it had this option would be excellent, otherwise not a bad app."
2217,"Pros - Really good app in terms of productivity and usability. - Love how it's possible to colour code and label tasks eg personal, work, university etc. - Love that it syncs with my Google calendar. - Plus I love the app's UI. - I also like the focus option; Cons - I think the focus option should be more like the forest app and not allow you to go away from the screen/tree, otherwise the tree dies. - I also think you should be able to add attachments to events like you can with Tasks."

2306, jet blue is okay I guess. They cancel flights and don`t have a lot of backup planes. And no first class
2307,Is just me or did this app kind of just get more complicated after the last update? I'm not sure what it is about it now that I don't appreciate but I really liked the last version much better... It seems too simplistic and it's still buggy...

2407,I love that I can check things off as I do them throughout the day and not the next day they reset so I can go to the list again without repeatingly putting them in the only thing I wish is either I could send the results daily to my calendar preferably automatically but at least manually or the app kept a history so I could tell how often I completed my goals.

I can set up how I want to take each medicine (yes/no or quantity), see the start date and adherence in the summary view, and even track side effects and effectiveness each day then see them in a chronological list in the sunmary. And the best part is that it's not tied to some medical database! Added bonus: I can track real to-dos as well. Overall, love this app!"

It's pretty satisfying to tap the little circle for a thing I did and see it turn green and link up with other days! Would definitely recommend."
2437,I know. How sad is that?  RT @caseymercier: 1st day of hurricane season. That's less scarey than govt taking over GM.

2477,"Widget seriously needs fixing. Screen real estate is important, and your widget is huge & wastes so much space. Please set up options for controlling text size in it & try to remove dead space, & the title of the app, since it's unnecessary. This is almost a deal breaker for me. :( Also, small request, is there any way you can change the task example to anything but the name Alex? Like ""someone"" instead, because honestly it triggers me pretty bad (abuser). Thanks for considering my comments."
2478,"It was working ok for a couple of months, then would not let me sign in.    Funny thing is I don't remember signing out!  I would simply hit the icon on my android and it would just be there.  Sure looks like it works for others."

I can Even go to tabs that I opened and didn't exit without my tree being killed. At first, I didn't know that it was that easy to fool the app,but after tad a bit of time,I realized that it was pretty easy to open youtube while my tree was growing and still ensure that my forest is lush and green.

2581,"Havent been using it for a long time but so far so good. However, the paid version should have more features, such a costomizing your own categories. Also, the widget should be more customizable, such as font size."

2586,"It doesnt seem to be possible to delete a single event in a series. So if I want to block off an hour every day for the same thing, but then I have to schedule a one-off thing during that time, I can't just delete one occurence and leave the rest of the future occurences alone. I love the app otherwise but this problem is pushing me toward a different app."

2598,"it's a wonderful app to help you focus more on your work or studies. you can select a time of how long you want to focus (you can choose from 10m to 2h) while doing that you also have a wide range of options available of all kinds of trees and bushes! the more time you select the more coins you get rewarded and with those coins you can buy new trees or bushes. i have bought the premium version for €1,99 which isn't much at all and because i have it i can personalise the app blacklist!"
2599,"Looks promising. Would like to see: routine sharing/sync (some routines you have to do with your wife), marking activity as done, have tags on timers and have more analytics on the actual timeline data (not routines).  I personally would pay a premium for these features."

2622,"I really like this app. Still having problems, trying to figure out how can it work best for me."
2623,Versão Free não faz quase nada. Quase enganação falar que o app é gratuito
2624,I really like this app so far. Its flexible ans very customizable. The only thing I would add is either more categories/the ability to add my own. Health and Home are very broad categories. So being able to have sub categories would be nice

2678,"Would you quit directing me to the website!? If I want to join a party/guild it should be done on the app. It won't let me log in on the site AT ALL.. Why you people would choose to have it so if you use ""log in using Google"", it resets and begins a whole new account without asking, now I have two accounts on one email? It won't even give me my password! I tried resetting it several times. How annoying, bad design. After I spent so much time on the app too, all for it not to work"
2679,LOVE THIS APP!! This app had saved me so many stressful headaches!! The creator is ALWAYS on top of it and so helpful with everyone's questions. Install this app - you won't be sorry!

2691, No.  Just sitting around sculpting tiny koi.
2692,"Sadly this is the best to do list I have seen.  Very glitchy.  Tasks done weeks ago magically show up and you have to delete them again.  A grocery list I didn't even want replicated itself 12 times.  My personal list replicated itself 13 times and when I deleted the second to last iteration of this it deleted everything I had ever typed into my lists.  Calendar support only available on ipad and android phone, not in browser window.  You have to trick the system into puting a date on items by setting a reminder and then going back in to deactivate the reminder.  I like that you can move items around however you want and that items left undone today stay in the today category instead of just floating out of the system.  It is odd that something as unfinished as this emerges as king of the hill in this category.  I would have thought that the global creativity and intelligence of humanity would have far surpassed this but apparently not."
2693,Confuzzled
2694,I`m still up! Thank you all for praying (: AHAHAHA! I`m watching Britney: For the Record until school. Today should be a good day
2695,GOODNIGHT MAGIC AND PRETTY WORLD
2696,App is great in terms of tracking or developing a habit and has great customizations for each. I loved the option of reminder but very dissapointed that it never works. I never get any notifications or reminders.

2705,"wish the reminder have had a repeat function(e.g. every week), so I don't have to recheck the tasks"
2706,"Like the structure of the daily appointments. So much easier to see my day at a glance. [Edit] Unfortunately I had to delete b/c would not update additional entries. Hence, 5 to 2 stars. [Edit 25Dec] I've noooo idea what changed to be fair probably system update or Google calendar. Regardless sync works beauuufifully! And absolutely delighted. So much so I purchased Pro (feed the peeps that make good stuff!) Thanx!"
2707,I would like to be able to move multiple tasks as subtasks instead of one at a time. That is the only criticism I have the rest is awesome!
2708,My lucky lucky friend is at a nickleback concert atm  i wish i was there
2709,"Really like this app, the layout, and ease of use. However, I did not see a way to go back and edit your scheduled days. Everything else you can edit,..time, date, category, but wanted to change my days and I had to delete the entry and start over to modify my scheduled days. Otherwise, I would've rated it 5☆s"
2710,I am sick  but Ians coming over so its all good ;)
2711, Yeah I`m kinda glad I did stay home
2712, cold & raining in inglewood
2713,I saw a squirrel get hit by a car while walking to bart this morning...wondering if there was anything I could have done.
2714,Why oh why do I always forget to take the medication I`m *supposed* to take 30 minutes before breakfast? Just taking it now at 1:30
2715,  it`s very pleasant. i sooo rarely just have time to kill...
2716,"I really love TimeTune in helping me better utilize my time, see where it is all going and plan routine tasks so that I can stay on top of my busy life. The only thing missing for me is the ability to tick things as completed and cross if not done. I'd love to be able to analyze my routine to see what worked well and what I struggled to acheive. I find it rewarding and motivating being able to check things off as done."
2717, nice .. I can`t ever get that from my ex!
2718,"This app is a tiny and easy to master planner and organizer. The interface is neat, and it has AMOLED dark theme. Everything is fine until I noticed that repeating tasks are not being repeated when there is no internet connection, which is for a traveller, is a hassle. I wish repeating tasks can be repeated again on the next day once checked even if the device is not connected to the internet."
2719,Wow Too Good
2720, it`s the best day ever. it`s my birthday
2721,i think i need a drink
2722,I have been trying to download the app but its just not happening. Please look into it.
2723,I really find this very useful and easy to use. Very user friendly. Only problem is there is no way to delete all completed tasks...it has to be done one by one. Any chance of fixing that?

2726, i wishhh!
2727, love it! Really its simple i think of a word and put twi on the front i should be more clever
2728,It would be much better if there was an option letting you categorize some apps as exceptions . For example I'm studying and then I need to use my dictionary but I can't cause If I want to do it I have to give up which is a bit annoying
2729,It would be great if the notifications actually works!! I don't get notified by any task I put in at all
2730,"The application is great! The UI is clean, easy to follow. It does exactly what it is intended to do. I have one suggestion. Alongside the possibility to add steps to the tasks, it would be great to be able to arbitrarily set the level of completion of one task with something like a slider. Say for example you set yourself the goal to watch a full youtube playlist. Everyday you move this task to ""My day"". You will want to be able to measure your progress each day without predefined steps."
2731,"1/ I'm very happy I paid for the app - I've used if for a couple years continuously now, and it has never let me down. 2/ This layout is excellent for taking my days schedule in at a glance. I highly reccomend trying it. 3/ The widget has pride of place on my homescreen, and my Android Wear watchface. The designer has done an incredible job of cramming all the important information into the widget, without confusing or overly cluttering the display. There are many useful customisations that I found easy to control."
2732, how was the ice cream?
2733,"I was glorious at 6.50 when I went outside, so why has it gone cold and cloudy now"

2742,60 days today  i can`t believe it`s been 2 months. i`m nervous about what i`m gonna say later. but i`m gonna keep comin back.
2743,"When I first downloaded this app I loved it. I enjoyed being able to see my day at a glance and everything was working fine. For some reason the widget will not open the app for me anymore and I have no idea how to fix it. I tried to uninstall the app and install it again and it still doesn't work. Anybody has any suggestions, I'm open to them. I use an android. Just to clarify, the app itself is still working, the widget is not."
2744, cuz ima always late haha dammit she got me good
2745,calling debby ryan!
2746,I have never rated an app before. I rave about it to others. It's the perfect blend of simplicity and options to customize. I love having the widget on my phone. I expanded it so I can see many items on my list. I love the different options for reminders and snoozing. I have a hard time transitioning from task to task. Only thing I struggle with is the manual reorder of tasks (hold and drag). Works better for moving tasks down than up. Maybe my screen is not responsive enough or I'm clumsy.
2747,good so far. only used a few times may review later on.
2748,  Getting dizzy. Going to have to lower my original raise. Please don`t think any less of me.

2791,"This app is perfect for tracking my habits. It allows an effective level of depth without being overwhelming. I have been using this for several months and I love it. The only thing I would like to see would be ""Milestones"" to increase/decrease a habit without retroactively turning past week successes into failures. For example, increasing a workout habit from 2x/wk to 3x/wk."

2825, what dey do homie? I wish it would stop raining already!! Plus my vacay is almost over
2826,"Pretty great app, motivates me to do stuff I normally wouldn't want to because of the prospect of leveling up. One small gripe I have is that if something with a reminder is marked complete before the reminder goes off, it still reminds you even though you've already done it. Also, sounds when you mark something, etc come out the Ringtone channel, not the Media channel."
2827," Another day and I couldn`t find you.    I ended up trying another cart, can`t remember their name.  `sigh`"

2834,"As much as I love the concept and I really do want to use it, the app doesn't log my times. I'll plant, and study, then when I come back (and my tree is supposed to be done growing) it'll just start up like nothing happened. I've had an empty forest for two days now."

2838,"An excellent app for everyone who struggles focusing on anything. Planting trees and preventing them from dying, then having a whole, beautiful forest is motivating. There's a global ranking refreshing each week, so you can compete with other players. You may even plant with your friends if you want. There are multiple tree species, updated quite often which makes the game just more exciting. I found paying for the premium version worth it."

2844,Works great
2845,"Love hate relationship. The app is great.. It nags and nags and @*! @@! nags per your settings until you want to kill it.. Dead!! And then again! But it does its job. The reminders are rude, intrusive, nagging, annoying and constant but acheive your goal of reminding you to take care of things until you actually achieve items on your list. I HATE it.. But it's supreme for procrastinators, busy people, air heads, and anyone else who needs a keeper to keep them on target. Phone/setting dependent"

2909,used it awhile ago and recently installed on my new phone. as soon as it opened it was clear i would not be able to use it. several things where off (like trying to put pictures in an office doc) worse still when i try to add many options are cut off by some form of white box that sits in the way. unfortunately dailies are one of the missing options and a huge part of how i personally used the app.
2910,"Good layout, unfortunately doesn't sync with  office 365."

2929,I bought the premium version of this app. It is easy to use and I love the reminders sent to my Galaxy watch to keep me on track. I would like bolder colour coding to differentiate the goals being tracked and success/failure indicators. Overall a great purchase.

3001," cant say i havee, im at james` but i did some rs yesterdayy!. im learning my quotess"
3002,_anderson hehe   fun tweets !
3003,For some weird reason the app (timer) stopped working after a few months of installing the app. I used to use it everyday but now all I can do is uninstall it. it's kinda weird how this is an editors choice app. I would give this a five star if this was fixed. and it would be much better if this was not a timer. I would much more prefer if you can add a start button and when you finished studying you can just stop it instead. you can't really estimate the time it takes for you to study.
3004, People from England can watch this one  Thankyou
3005,Moving today!!  I`m so excited!
3006,One of the apps in my toolbox. Manages my time well. Has good features. Thanks for the developers
3007,Well this is awkward but I cant even find widget option for this app in phone. Downloaded just an hour ago so this has to be the latest version I believe. The whole purpose was to have a clock on my homescreen that has my calender synced. It doesnt seem to that. May be I'm missing something here? I'll definite give an update of this review if I can figured it out.
3008,I am a loyal user of wunderlist. switching to to do is awful. could not function at all. for instance no list for today and week. I guess I have to find another app.
3009,"-When editing or deleting a recurring task it should ask if you're doing it just for this task or all recurring tasks, instead of deleting and editing all tasks without asking. 2- when creating a recurring task I should be able to time it on different times for each reccuring day, instead of having to create the same reccuring task for each seperate day"

3020,Demands premium account for serving the most basic features
3021,Ugh... Waiting.... Interminable...
3022,Clear Concisive Calendar. Like the sharing capabilities. Haven't had any issues.
3023,"Its almost there, but a bit buggy. I used Chrome OS and Chromebook. The app does not handle recurring reminders properly. When I mark the reminder as done it should automatically reschedule for the next occurance. When I mark as 'done' the task goes away forever. I contacted support and shared a video of the behavior. They acknowledge a bug, but that's been weeks ago. I have no faith yet the recurring reminders are reliable. Proceed here with caution if you rely on strong reminders such as I do, as you could be left hanging and missing an important task."
3024,finally home  crazy party 2nite! thanks  4 driving me home!
3025,"Really good. I woul like to export my data but other than that, i love it"
3026,"Much prefer the look/layout of Wunderlist. Lots of little things in To Do that aren't as good as Wunderlist and it's a huge shame that it is being retired for this. As a minimum, everyone should have the option of making it look exactly the same so we don't notice the difference. As it is, the text is too big, extra items that can't be turned off such as 'My Day' clutter the screen and it just doesn't look/feel as good. Shame"
3027,"Hanging out with sam, billy, and veronica. not going to school tomorrow to take sam to body shops. Dang car accidents"

3030,"A intenção é boa, mas a interface é bastante confusa. || The intention is good, but the interface is too confusing"
3031,_Atticus Thank you
3032,"Such a waste of such a great app. Would have given it five stars if it didn't constantly crash, causing it to either not open once time's up unless I force close (losing my tree) or not notifying me in the first place as it crashed halfway through (and again losing my tree). I hope this can be fixed in the near future because I'm not willing on giving up on this app this soon"

3045,Disappointed that you can't share lists across organizations. Doesn't help when you trying to keep track of tasks and collobrations to do lists with people in other companies.
3046,Good habit tracker
3047,Nice app but UX can be improved.
3048,I need one more follower.
3049,"The app works once and the second time i try to open it, it just refuses to open! I have redownloaded the app many times but this problem continues. Other than that, I really enjoy this app. Edit: I have sent the problems on the said email. Edit: they did respond and the app works fine now :) excellent customer service!"

3058,"You responded to but STILL DON'T understand my comment about repeating event scheduling. I KNOW that you can schedule repeating events, & I KNOW how to do that, but each repeating event is scheduled at intervals reliant on the original event date. What if I sometimes would like the event to repeat from the actual completion date? For example, I forget to renew my library books for a week. When I renew them finally l have 3 weeks before I need to review them again but your system says 2."

Like this app but until recently I had to change phones and the database could not locate my email and the app changed names and logo so it's all confusing. If you could help me locate my account as I bought the premium version but couldnt log in to my account. Please help because I want to use this great app!"

Another feature that I had used extensively is feature of repeated tasks, that have helped me in forming few good habits."

Very restrictive: the widget shows full info for one day, and no info ahead, unless you select a different day. For the days ahead you need to leave the widget, and work in a different environment. Why complicate your life? Find a calendar app you like, stay with it, come back to Sectograph when (and if) the widget fully implements time and task management."

3126,"This is hands down the best personal planning app I've ever come across. That being said, it's basically unusable on Android. The view jumps to the top of the day's task list at random, making it easy to accidentally check off the wrong task. It takes minutes to load anything when you try to access the rest of the app through the back arrow at the top left. And, on occasion, tasks will duplicate themselves multiple times with different parameters. I use it on my iPad with no trouble at all."

I really don't like that the plant only changes or ""evolves"" with at least 60 minutes. Now it feels like anything under that does not matter. If I focus for 10 minutes or 50 minutes makes no difference in the app, which is a little demotivating. Please consider changing this. Other than that, phenomenal app."

After setting it up on my phone, which was easy but took some time,when I tried logging onto my son's phone it didn't recognize the account. I contacted customer service but didn't hear back. It's a nice app, really like the features, so this was really disappointing. I could set it up again on his phone but without me being able to monitor on my phone it's not helpful. I still hope someone can help me fix this or I should get a refund for my purchase."

3349,Amazing app. Beats the even best ones out there. Good work. Keep it up.. keep improving..
3350,Edit: Still doesn't work. I suggest adding proper integration with Outlook because it is leaps and bounds ahead of Google in terms of usability and ease. - Before Edit: Doesn't show me the events already listed on my Outlook calendar. Every day is blank. When I go to add an event with only Outlook calendar selected it wants me to add an event into another calendar. I don't care about adding events (I can do it on another platform) but if can't even see my Outlook events then this is useless. Gave it all necessary permissions and checked dates and synced.

3377,"Really great app, fast and snappy like a to-do app should be like so you don't miss any thoughts, my biggest issue with this app is that there is no one time pay to buy option for it, while I find it useful I don't need a lot of the pro features, I am a basic user and need it just to track my personal tasks, as such the monthly payment subscription for the Pro version does not make sense to me, why not add a basic pro model, with limited features, that users can outright buy forever."
3378,YEHEY SUMMER!!  so exciteeeddd.. balme it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol.

3383,So far this app has been terrific. With all its catagories that you can organize your tasks into it keeps it from getting cluttered and confusing. So far all the alarms have been working and functioning as they are supposed to and it has been easy to use with a quick tutorial when you first open it up.
3384, You are `spot on`...I wouldn`t tweet without it!! Thanks for your share tonight.
3385,"Fits my needs. The free version is limited to five items being tracked, but it would be counterproductive to try and develop more than two habits at a time."
3386,"I like that it allows specific habits, I don't like that it does not give proper percentages of how much you've done your habits. after using it about a month i deleted it, because even though i was doing almost every habit 100%, it kept giving me <50%. it was demoralizing."

3443,"For me it takes a lot of additional actions to schedule a task and set the reminders. Even in free apps I can do it easier. For one task I've left comments from mobile phone, however I couldn't find then. They were only in the web version. Of cource there are things that I like: projects, subtasks, labels, reminders by location. And access from a mobile phone and a browser."
3444,"Task repeat options are garbage. For basic things it's ok, but don't expect more than that."

3472,#3wordsaftersex it hurts now
3473,"It's a GREAT app. 4 Stars because I think one addition would be a way to have 2 identical widgets running without being connected. Like 1 widget set for my daily goals tasks (shower, laundry, gym), and the second widget for tasks I update and add throughout the day (pick up milk, get haircut)! That way i don't get overwhelmed by a single long list but instead have 2 smaller lists. I'm a ""one screen all widgets"" guy. Another addition would possibly be a widget calendar list, instead of having the 30 day calendar + each days events. Seems useless to have such a huge window of calendar days when I really just need to have a list of events of each day. Samsung calendar has this widget and it's perfect."
3474, aw i`m sorry  i was rooting for you just to let you know!

3484,"This app is perfect for my personal task management. You can make it as simple or complex as you want. I like how easy it is to quick add tasks, schedule, and how I can integrate with Gcal.

3572,"A great app overall. Complete and specific in terms of types of goals. User interface aspects like fonts and some screens like the first ""create habit"" screen seem a little heterogeneous when compared to the rest of the app; in other words, they seem displaced, out of vibe. I suggest a review of the UI; maybe making it a little less cluttery and cleaner. For example, the google fit prompts and font correlation. It is a great work nevertheless, congratulations!"
3573,I Need a freaking adventure.
3574, http://twitpic.com/66st1 - please let me freee... I can`t watch you **** for much loongerrr!

3577,"If you use Gmail, calendar go with Google tasks free with much more functions and integrated with your calendar events, reminder, tasks without subscription. Stick with the big guys! Waste of time with this app."
3578, mmmmm you have someone on the inside ? or are you being brlliant again
3579,I believe that u should introduce a better interface to explain its working and  an optoon to create day plans accaording to ur schedule and not with a calender..i mean a time planner...ao that i can plan my time accordingly by a pie chart
3580,Great app motivates you to keep going
3581,This is literally just another calendar app. Misleading calling it a planner. Smh. It's not even a good calendar. If you're hunting for a good planning app keep looking because this is definitely not it!!!
3582, ... schedule says 10:30 class? I will be late for 10  #campjitterbug

3599,Because it takes aiges to download���
3600,Very nice app and easy to use. My only complaint is that I wish there was an option to have a weekly view in block format like a planner versus just the timeline. But it is still very convient to use the routines.
3601, http://twitpic.com/4jg09 - looks exactly like I do when I get that GH guitar in my hand

3608, Can you talk to my hubby  and convince him that that`s a great present for ALL mommies???
3609,"Not Fully Developed. This app could be great, but in their rush to put it out, the features are highly lacking. No push notifications, you cannot upload stickers, no widget, pretty buggy. I really liked the idea of it, but it needs improvement. I will update to 5 stars if and when these features are added. They did reach out to me to resolve my issues, so I am updating to three stars."
3610,"Just got done with my first day of work and is exsausted, sweaty, and chalky."

3618,"Recently the app has shown a bug in repeat appointments. I always have repeated 3-day-appointment for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. It starts in the evening of Friday and ends next Sat morning, Saturday evening to next Sunday morning, and Sunday evening to next Monday morning. After Monday, the appointment repeats every 5 weeks. It used to work correctly until mid 2018. Now, the Sunday-evening-to-next-Monday-morning appointment appears in the week before the correct week. Please fix it. Thanks"

3622,"Terrible, Wunderlist worked well, nothing seems to work now, transitioning was not easy, I had to set up an account I don't want and don't need. I am not happy, Microsoft has not done well with making things user-friendly for some time now, I wouldn't be surprised if they don't start stealing everyone's information and using it without ""consent"" like apple does. Oh wait, I can't tell the difference between any of these companies now, and I am pretty sure they all do that and don't care! GFY!"
3623, Hope you feel better soon.

3626,"I like having the choice of what to add to my To Day every morning. It gives me a chance to review and decide what is important today. One negative..when you check off a reaccuring task, the next scheduled one pops up. Every time I review the list my eye has to stop and check the little date to make sure it isn't a task for today."

3677,"Good app, does what I need it to."
3678," Awwwww, i`m sorry"
3679,"It is really a useful app and I liked it, But I have a proplem that my tree doesn't die when I leave the app. It actually blocks me from using apps, but when I remove it from the background (tapping the right button and remove it by scrolling up), I can open any app and forest stops working. What I want exacly is to make my tree die when I leave forest and never be able to use apps when I try to do so during focusing time. Please tell me if there is any solution for this and thank you so much."

3762,"So far so good. Just started using this app about a week ago. It's working well and is pretty clear cut as to adding or editing the habits. I like the option for reminders. If it continues to work well in the next few weeks, am thinking of buying premium at discounted "" launch"" price of $4.99 . That describes widgets as an extra and I am just wondering what that means."
3763,its almost lunch time for you

3769,"I am a paid user of this app. I like this app a lot, until Android 10. They claim what they used to do is not possible but that is not true because another app I use (Daylio) has a nice notification that jumps out at you, like Any.do used to. Now Any.do gives a regular ignorable notification which you click and the app does something on the screen and is pretty pathetic, THEN it gives it's notification to plan your day. So it's two clicks with a big visual pause in between. Not cool. �"

3807,"Great application! I use it across all of my platforms, seamlessly. Keeps me organized for my day to day, week to week, month to month, and year to year tasks. I can attach documents, pictures, etc for all tasks which is very useful. Before TickTick, I used Toodeldo. It was okay, but TickTick is just leaps and bounds better than Toodeldo. If you want and need organization in your life, TickTick is the application for you!"
3808," Ahh.  ... Well, I was hoping that I could learn some stuff on the way. ... Why not you and I work on separate things but also"
3809,"Todoist is garbage. Nevermind the idiotic text-based method for creating daily tasks, this stupid app seems to think ""every day"" is a suggestion, even with Premium. Been using this app for three weeks & every few days, it refuses to renew my daily tasks. Scheduled reminders disappear. Curse & blast whoever EOL'd Wunderlist cuz it was perfect for my needs. This todoist trash? Not at all. I will cling to Wunderlist until the very end."

3819,since the May 1st update it made me create my character 15+ times before I uninstalled and reinstalled before having to do it again and spending close to 45 minutes deleting pre generated habits dailies and to dos to get to my original ones. Terrible. I love the app otherwise. Update: since the new update it is fixed.
3820,Glad to be home I wish I could make  feel better
3821, Me neither. But it`s no longer about what we want. It`s about fairness. And fairness is whatever government says it is.
3822,"The app is running while I type this review, meaning I am able to just leave the app and do something else without my tree dying. Just spent 45 minutes trying to set up the app, which is ridiculous. I tried to follow the instructions, but they were really outdated and the settings don't operate like that anymore.

3826,"I have been using this app for nearly a year. However, lately it has been crashing so frequently that I reinstalled it few times in two days. It keep crashing again and again. It also sometimes doesn't count the time and resets itself. I am very disappointed that I will stop using it unfortunately if it doesn't get fixed."
3827,A more in depth kind of to-do list. Plus you get to monitor where the kind of activities you do would lead you in the long run. Good job.
3828,The reminders aren't partixularly noticeable.

3830,"A glorified ""stock calendar"", as Tech Support calls it (the native Calendar app). Forget it if you have an Outlook calendar; notwithstanding what appears on the app, only Exchange is supported. Seems they spent more time on bells and whistles than the underlying architecture of the app"

3871,"New update to the widget makes it so I can no longer get into the full app by tapping on the widget, I actually have to go into my list of apps or create a whole other shortcut. You tout a fully operational widget but I can't rearrange my list entries via the widget, only the full app menu (and it was already a pain to rearrange my tasks in the first place, I really really wish there was an option to add new tasks to the top of the list rather than the bottom.) I will be trying out new to-do list apps now."

The alerts only work when I open the app. pointless!"

3885,"I paid for the pro version after playing with the app for a few minutes. Was hoping to use this to help manage my ADHD but I have two big issues with the app 1) I can't find a way to edit routines after they've already been created WITHOUT deleting the whole day. I don't think there is. 2) After I clear a day, the app shuts down.   I can deal with the second issue until an update but I don't think I would have purchased the upgraded version if I would have been aware of the first issue. Still, three stars because other than the glitch & missing feature the app does exactly what it says it will."
3886, hey Gerardo! (late response) that day i was talking bout forgiving my brother 4 givin me wrong directions! i got way to upset
3887,Must download. The app is very much useful. It had helped me get on track when I wasn't in a position of self reflection.

3889, don`t you procrastinate!   (like I do...)
3890,"Nice app! But almost everything from the menu needs a premium verson to use it. At least keep the friends section as a free section, so people will get other people involved in this."

3892,"Thanks forest its a really great app. But, sometimes when I am not connected to the internet it doesn't work. When I want to plan and push the button, nothing changes. And this really bothers me cuz i love this app and its a really crazy problem that I want you to fix it. Tnx again"

3898," I will take lots of pics! it is really pretty there, lots of palm trees."
3899,I really love this app and recommend it to anyone but since i went premium nothing works. I can't go to the shop section or see my achievements. I hope they'll fix those issues with an update soon. Only 1 star because of the issues otherwise would have been 5 stars.
3900," new album is truly genius, so happy with it"
3901,This app only connects you with google calendar and that's it. Not useful
3902,"Perfect app, except for 12-hour sync with Google calendar"

3904,"it's a great idea but it just doesn't work! The pages never refresh for the next day, and if i press the refresh button it just comes up with an unable to connect to server error, or just stays with the loading symbol infinitely. I went on it today after not going on it for a couple of days and i just find that im dead out of nowhere. The ""refill health"" prompt kept repeatedly popping up and then when it stopped my health bar was still at zero. Also the add habit button isnt there always..."

3921,What gives you as much flexibility as you need: + projects to grope tasks + lables + powerful filters alow you to create you personal views But: - it is possible to syncronize ONLY one google calendar!!! (which is funny as for Editor's choice app) - it is not possible to grope labels to set common color or search pattern - it is not possible to label a project so that all tasks created in a project get this label. I hole guys will fix the issue with calender otherwise all props do not worth it.

I may keep it on longer than the prescribed 66 days. The app claims it takes that long to develop a lasting habit but the daily reminders help me best. This app is good for that."

3959,Without syncing to the cloud this todo app is unfortunately worthless. Love it otherwise and would have given it 4 or 5 stars. Please add sync since in my quest to find a good todo app this is the only one I've seen that doesn't sync anywhere between devices.
3960,"The tasks completed are no longer shown on the date itself, which made us hard to trace back what were the activities done on that particular day Add on review: thanks for the reply.

3980,"VERY GOOD and far better than most of the similar apps that I have tried so far. It would be great if weekly schedule could be added for an specific habit, so you could be reminded at different times during different days of the week; which sounds more functional and reasonable as we usually don't have a fixed routine during the week. Needless to say what a big improvement a companion smart watch app would be!"

3997,Great but over half the time when I edit a task it changes the year to the 1960s even though it says 2019 when selected.
3998,Was 5 stars lowering to 2 so hopefully they see this - make the completed tasks section it's own thing again why would I want it merged with my existing tasks? Makes it very hard to find accidentally closed tasks or to look thru historical data. Dont think this change was necessary

4009,"Tasks cannot be ordered by their time. A habit not done is not shown as overdue. EDIT: I checked again to use it, but 1) Recurring task cannot be created. 2) Habits are shown like scheduled tasks. It's motivating to see habit progress instead on landing screen 3) It's more useful to see progress on habit activity instead of successful day. If we set to do 2 times a day but we could do it only once, it should show progress for a 30 day goal as 1/2 (today), 1/60 (total) instead of 0/30 or 1/30."
4010,"Download it because I love that it has a weekly, monthly and daily goal views, also lists and water intake goals but it doesn't have push notifications and it seems like I can't cross off events, only goals or tasks and that's a huge deal at least for me so it would be great if you guys can make that happen"

4074,"Overall, I enjoy this app. However, I just needed to call 911, and the app made me confirm more than once if I really wanted to kill the tree before I could make the call. There should be an emergency-kill-without-question button or option or something, because that is not safe."

4201,"I love it except, and this is a big issue for me, it's totally server based. Want to update anything, but have a bad internet connection? Too bad, it's either going to take forever or fail. I would use and maybe even pay for this app to just have a way to have everything first be saved on my device. So, back to hunting for a to-do app. Edit 3/23: I have to drop my review on this to 1 star. You can manually edit values within the app for stats making any it unreasonable that I need internet."

4214,I've been really enjoying this app. The My Day feature is really useful for managing my tasks and Its so easy to just add new tasks as I get them. I especially love that you can add tasks from the previous day to your current My Day. It has a simple and streamlined design and seamlessly integrates my phones theme. The only thing I would improve would be the ability to add tasks to My Day in advance.
4215, Hi Its not about howmany people follow you its about how much you help others
4216,finally leaving this place! woohoo! school time!
4217,"I like it a lot. But it doesn't have as much of the GAME aspect to it. I wish there was a feature where you character could actually play in an rpg game using the equipment and skills you earned. You could have a little rpg game on the side and has cute little morality stories. Without it, it doesn't really incentivize much."

4266,I like that you value privacy. So I'm disappointed that tasks within a project can't be broken down into more tasks. The comments feature doesn't seem to be enough of a supplement.

4297,One lactose pill is not enough for coffee....oopse
4298,"It's good, but everytime I mark a task as completed on the widget I have to open the app and tell it to sort my tasks by date again. You guys should include a setting to choose how you want your tasks ordered and reorder them by that setting everytime. Cause it's annoying having them reorder themselves in a way I dislike constantly."

If you buy the pro version it comes with the 24 hour feature, which I think is totally worth it. Seeing 24 hour option you can see everything from start to finish and not miss anything."
4349,having my dinner. eating bangus.  it`s a fish.
4350,This app is outstanding! I love dark mode so I upgraded to premium & it's 100% worth it. Excellent app. Great to organize & motivate yourself. Thank you
4351,why doesnt the widget remember to sort by date? i have to keep going into the app to select sort by date.. can this be fixed???
4352, Thanks a lot! You`re very kind!  I just got back from a nice drive in the 500. Such a fun car to drive  Have a nice day!
4353,A new isdue has cropped up. When editing a multiday event that you want to extend 1 more day you must include two additional days in order gor the app to show the one additional day you wish added. Most strange issue
4354, It is! Wish there was one in our area.

4361,"The alarm feature does not work, which leads to missing the tasks."
4362,"Overall good app. Interface is easy to use, effective and powerful. Would be good if it had better integration with calendars and other services. While many features are free, premium is a continuous subscription and quickly adds up to be very expensive."
4363,  the website is http://tinyurl.com/c7yojg  idk if the place is around ur area..

4365,wonders why am I so clumsy lately?  http://plurk.com/p/x28ka
4366,"Nice app. I wrote the developer and was able to get a prompt response. 
Unfortunately for me, the backup and restore process did not work at all 
and I will be unable to actually use it. I may look for another update and 
try at a later time, but for now this just is not smooth enough between 
different devices for me."

I love having all of my appointments in one place and it's so easy to use! I especially enjoy the extra feature of being able to add notes to my tasks! It has helped me stay on task with work, cleaning, and everything else!"

4391,"I'm sure it would be great if it didn't pick and chose what events to display from my calendar. I have multiple events logged in my calendar, the only calendar it's synced to and the only calendar those events are logged on, yet just one of them shows up. It has a lovely design, but that doesn't mean anything when the app doesn't actually work for what it's intended for."

4403, your making me jealous now  I want one! How long have u guys been married?
4404,It needs me to pay again for the app once I've updated this app. The drag and drop feature had just gone suddenly silently.
4405,Great for organizing!
4406,"well no phone today, we are waiting till June 9th to get a better deal sooooo  but its all good"
4407," yeah real hard, but I know you`ll get by with it... smile"
4408,Very useful app. Colourful too
4409,Well its a good thing ``march`` wasnt very long and i didnt like it...cuz its deleted. Ugh
4410,"Extremely helpful app!! Helps me be very organized. I used to make paper lists, but I would lose them. This allows me to keep my to do lists in one place and is very easy to add tasks. I would like to see a feature where you can populate it daily/weekly/monthly . (ex. Morning routine daily, Vacuum weekly, mail out the electric bill monthly)"

4423,"Well good morning all, What a wonderful day in the neighborhood  Thanks for all those that are now following another 60 this morning"
4424,"Really amazing, but there are pop-up adverts if you're not a member, and for someone like me that's quite a few adverts daily. Very annoying!, But everything else is PERFECT. FYI The designers have to eat so I'm not mad but God damn that's annoying Would be really cool if you could at least watch a bunch of adverts at once so you don't have to do it later. Just an idea id be up for."
4425,"Very nice app for productivity. My favorite feature is that tasks and dailies that are finished can he hidden. However, it requires connection too much. Wouldn't mind syncing from time to time but I'd really hope there could be a way to tick off tasks even offline. Also would love to see ""weeklies"" or something that doesn't reset everyday for goals like ""go to gym 3x this week"" or ""walk dogs 5x this week"". Integration of calendar events would also be nice."

The world of Habitica feels like a supportive community of people holding each other accountable and helping each other accomplish their goals. Doing my daily chores is so much more fun when I turn it into a quest for magical potions and eggs!

4467,"It seems OK, but very basic. Recurring tasks need some work to be actually useful. For example, it would be nice to be able to set a task to be recurring on the first of every month, without only being able to set that up on the first of the month. Edit; I also just noticed that there is no dark theme. Both may be available as paid for options, but I'll never know, since they are basic options and without them, I have no reason to try this app, and thus will never pay for actual premium options."

4487,"Almost perfect. The only changes that would be helpful is a quicker way to switch from the week view to the task list. And i would like to see my tasks as a list by default instead of clicking on the task categories. Also I wish that you had a rollover option for tasks, I have yet to find an app that had this: basically I wish when I create a task I could choose if the task carries forward to the next day if not completed or not."
4488,"I like the app but I'm not getting notifications of reminders. Have checked all the settings, might be that my phone's too old to be fully compatible"

4506,"Great concept, but there are numerous issues that I found right off the bat. The main one for me was the fact that, once you pick a subject for your journey you can never go back and change that. I mean, there are multiple journey subjects to choose from and maybe I want to focus on one aspect of my life at a time. The app treats life like a game, after all and most games allow you to start over with different settings. Starting over in THIS game requires you to uninstall the app, reinstall the app and then create a brand new account. Kind of silly and frustrating to boot. Check out the Level Life Up app instead. It has a much better platform."
4507,"I like Wunderlist more. The widget was more clear and date of not completed tasks had red color, which was for me visually much better.

Buttons missing labels or information, lethargic loading issues, and the graphics are really sub par for what other games host currently. Even the initial avatar appearance has most things locked behind a pay wall, and keeps putting me in a wheelchair! The idea behind the app has a lot of potential, and would be a joy to see if they can make it better and working properly. Will have to wait and see. As is? Not functional."

4731,"I've been using the app for a while mostly just as a reminder app. Finally, I put together a plan to use it as my primary task tracker. Great app for managing tasks � A little learning curve � Sync with Google Calendar was easy � No CUSTOM Task reminder sounds?!!? � (� sound = Drink) Also, no multi-reminders for Tasks or times for Subtasks.

4759,The idea is better than the execution. Buying things from the store requires you to create an account in their app rather than using the play store account. Creating an account requires you to enter a birthday which uses a horrible calendar form that requires you to arrow-over every month in every year until you get to your birthday. I'm not doing that... The sound turns off randomly (before the end of the session). Switching to another app doesn't trigger in session warning consistently.

4771,"Excellent app, with plenty of functionality for free users and worthy upgrades for paid users. I love that it can be used across multiple platforms. That being said, it's super unreliable so I'd never upgrade. Repeated tasks sometimes get marked off and stay on the current day, needing to be marked completed as many as 5-7x before moving to the next day. Sometimes when you add a task it'll disappear; maybe related to server syncing. But not always, so you better remember (defeats the purpose)!"

I could opt out of seeing personalised ads on this app i couldnt opt of my data being collected and combined with other sources and shared by all of their many advertising partners, which for an app like this is just too invasive.

4821,"In general, this app helps me keep track of my habits, which is great; however, the app has quite a few bugs, even after buying the premium version, which is disappointing. The sync function doesn't work at all and I don't see any effort to fix these issues. This is one of the rare apps where I won't be giving a 5 star review."

I highly recommend this app."

4848,"@ RyanSeacrest : hi there might be a problem as it says no stream online, wat`s not right?"

4851,: just had my debut on Thursday @ The Gallery Lounge! It was fun... can`t wait to do the next one!!
4852," ah, I misunderstood your message. but really dislike the F word in the url   good luck with the march"
4853,Overall it's a great app that I use every day but what I truly hate is I paid for the full version and since I have 3 Google accounts in my phone no matter what instructions I'm given by the developer it doesn't recognize I bought it because it defaults to the wrong account. If they fix and let me select correct amount I'll bump my rating back up. Should have an option. Sad
4854,Writing in yearbooks make me wanna cry

4890,"Ever since the update to at a Whitelist to allow me to use my phone apps such as Google Docs , Notepad, Duolingo, etc. It's been a lot more wonderful of an experience as someone who doesn't always have access to a laptop/computer for homework. Love planting real trees but I do love the updates that come with more variety of our own forests so that I can have weekly themes. Can't wait to see more flowers as well, my suggestion is a colorful bunch of Lilies! Honeysuckles would be adorable too."
4891," I know, twitter is depressing me tonight"
4892,"Very hard to use. Cannot get a list of task to do, until do date"
4893,Wunderlist was better. Now i have to push more buttons than before. Dont even know how to prioitize a task when i add it. Why not leave it the way it was and just brand it MS?

4907, I can only promise about 150 or so.

4919,"Thanks for your comments. Why does Google Calendar sync perfectly and BC not, when all on the same account, I think? Some while ago, possibly due to an update, this stopped syncing reliably either regularly or even when sync button pressed in Business Calendar menu. Deleting an event on this Samsung Galaxy phone sometimes forces a sync. Sync is important as I use this with Google Calendar on desktop. Previously wrote: Easy to use and great that I can copy appointments."

4929,"I like the app. Except for some reason it now says it doesn't work with my account even though I can use it everywhere else. I've done all the ""IT"" things I can think to do. But to no avail. Guess I'll be looking elsewhere now."
4930,"This app is a fantastic idea, but man is it buggy. I'm constantly having to restart the app or check it later because it's bugging out. Would be 5 stars otherwise."
4931, I been following.... LOL.. just dont be paying attention to little ol Mylan
4932," most definitely will!  also, i wanted to say 'perfect time' was my favorite track! it seriously made me tear up!"

4944,is sad because his tea and oatmeal are cold
4945,"Almost there..! This app is the almost perfect solution for my job. I suggest for subtasks to have their own text formatting and check lists. Additionally, the summary page is cluttered: If I could turn off task descriptions within the summary, but still keep subtasks, I could better understand my weekly summaries. Lastly, I want to mark (sub)tasks as NOT COMPLETE if I know I didn't complete a task but I don't want it showing up as overdue. Summary formatting for this would remain the same."
4946,"Good morning universe, how are you today"
4947, I`m still trying to see Star Trek! I`ll just have to Woman up and go alone. BF is pretty much worthless anyway  lol
4948, cut it off.

4972,"I love that you can chose x amount of days a week to complete a habit, other apps force you to commit to specific days, the flexibility in this app helps me succeed, what I hate about this app is it fails to get my habit completion-for example I did my workout for the day but still receive repeated notices to do said workout for that day. way to drain any joy out of an accomplishment habitbull!"
4973,someone broke into my car big time = having a really bad day

But It happens only with this App. Could you guys please check what is going on? I do appreciate it, thank you. Thank you for tour reply. It jist disappear from my cel regularly and I have to reinstall it, again and again. I use to move the app from the cel to the SD card. I will try to follow your instructions. Thank you."

4981,"I absolutely adore this app. It keeps me from getting overwhelmed, but also keeps my house clean because I only take care of what's on my Tasks that day."
4982,Only thing I don't like is that when creating a recurring event the date doesn't show on the monthly view until you scroll over to the actual week of the event it would be a lot better if I could see those dates on the monthly view without having to scroll fix please for 5 star rating

4987,"Update to my original review -- to clarify, I'm saying that in previous versions you could choose which list to put the task under when doing a quick add of it via the ""+"" widget on home screen, and same for adding it from the bottom quick bar in the app. In the current version, it doesn't allow you to choose the list when doing a quick add. Your reply to my review is describing the regular (long) way of adding the task. I want to be able to choose the list when quick adding from the ""+"" widget!"
4988, I prefer overcast days too. Sorry it`s hot where you are.
4989,"I used to love this app but since installing the latest version on my new Samsung 10 the Google Tasks sync has stopped working. It synchronises from Google to Business Calendar but will not synchronise from Business Calendar to Google. ] I have tried disconnecting my Google account and reconnecting, I've made sure BC2 Tasks is associated with my Google account and all Sync settings are turned on. Is this is a known issue and if so will a fix be developed please? Thanks."

4998,Sadness  The top horde guild that I liked disbanded.
4999, oh great!  hope you`ll have a blast there! ;)
5000,"I used to use Habitica, and I must say this is a great step up. I'd like to see more social features, such as sharing tasks - only one person has to perform said task for it to be checked off, but only giving that person the experience and gold. Otherwise, the price for subscription is too steep, thus resulting in a sub-perfect score. I could easily justify $0.99/month or eternal subscription for $15. If that price could be met, as well as fine tuning, this would be easily worth 5 stars."

5024," I spoke too soon  Still a nice evening, but lots of broken cloud coming in from the south."
5025,This App have good design and good Features. I am using this app for 2 weeks and I comfortable with this app.
5026,Waste of time. Unhelpful and unmotivating.
5027,"Used it in the past and wasn't too happy with it. Tried it again, and now I have no idea why I didn't like it before. I especially love the integration of the to do /task list within the app. I use the Agenda view on the widget and couldn't be more pleased. As the title says, I love it! Several years later and still living it. Wouldn't think of changing it for anything. Rating dropped from 5 to 3 stars. Too many features removed with recent updates."
5028,"Fyi- putting makeup on under flourescents = FAIL. ... oh face-peely, why must you look so hideous? Also, wheres my lipstick?"

5034,Thinks he may have broken his nose at the show
5035,Imo this app is completely useless and you are better off locking yourself in a room with a clock. The whole forest aspect is a scam and all the trees are super tedious to obtain depending on one's study needs. And to pay premium to plnt real trees is a feel good way to buyg their product and it takes 3 days of studying to plant a tree. Yes I paid premium. I use ecosia and I planted over 400 trees web surfing. The sounds are useless too as you can get tons of sounds on other app effortlessly.
5036,is at school. its her last day. of high school. ever. ever. ever.
5037,It took me a while to login because of terrible security checking. And after it suggested to migrate all the data from Wunderlist without option to cancel. Terrible beginning.
5038,"Great potential, but I can't use the app to its full extent due to its counter-intuitive layout. Just filling two days in Routine view turned it into an endless scroll. Shame, the app really looked like what I was looking for. Reply: Thanks for taking my review into account. Yes, I think a horisontal orientation would be much better. Maybe leave both options? That way everyone can decide what best suits them."
5039,  congratulations on your shirt btw!

5054,"It's sadly evident that most to-do list apps are created by people with remarkably little to do. This is a delightful rare exception. Logical, simple but powerful, with all the basic necessities covered and good customization options, this is the closest mobile equivalent to AbstractSpoon's ToDoList available. Edit: Removing one star for the total removal of local backup. Monetization is understandable and deserved, but removal of a simple local failsafe to push (Premium) cloud backup reeks."
5055,"My notifications bar is telling me i have no tasks today even when i know i do which is kind of frustrating. Plus when i log into the app, my tasks aren't in chronological order for some reason after i set times for them at the beginning of the day. Other than that, i think it's a fab app and i love the little pop ups that happen at the beginning of the day and when a task needs to be done!"

5078,The concept is great and it's a fun way to keep track of your habits. My only gripes are: -I wish there was a better way to see habit streaks. The number is cool but if we could see it on a calendar like view I think that would be helpful. You could miss a day and if streaks aren't set to reset the number remains unchanged. -Better explanation of the colors on streaks. I still don't know what they mean (going to Google it). -You can't use rogue skills because you get a blue screen.
5079,"While changing list, by scrolling right to left, task get deleted, it's very confusing"

5083,"After purchasing the Pro Version and having used this calendar app for almost 2 to 3 years now, I have grown to truly love it. It mimicks as close to the Franklin Covey Planner's to any app out there I have found and this is what has drawn me to it. I am increasing my rating to 4 stars, because I have really had time to utilize all aspects of this calendar and I love that it will sink with my Google calendar and other calendars. I love this app, I only wish it could print."

5085,"I love this app. I use it for motivation with my writing. I custimized the skills, characteristics, achievements, and my hero levels to reflect my writerly ways and it's been so fun to use! Watching my skills and levels increase is a blast. I also appreciate the"" rewards""options, but wish I could create""in-app"" rewards for myself. Like potions or consumables that could increase a skill or boost XP earning for one day, etc. Even without that, though, this app is amazing! I highly recommend it."

First one of these I saw - UNINSTALLED!! ... Response: The ads definitely come up more than twice per day and the calendar is definitely NOT functional while the ads are running - you must wait for the commercial to end before you can open the calendar again. I can understand bar ads at the top or bottom of a free app, but full length commercials?!"
