One  thing that   makes   this a 4-star (above  average)   app  rather than   3   (average),  is  the automatic  inclusion of past-due   tasks  in  Today-list.  Of   course,   if it's  past due,   it has   to  be   due today.   Somehow most to-do   apps miss   this.   5-stars will be  when(or  if)  they   actually  release   the google  assistant   integration  and it actually   works without   issues. That Zapier-stuff, though.... what   a  joke. If anyone   has   the   time to  deal with that,   they   have plenty  of  extra   time   and have  no   need for a   to-do   app. Also, including zapier   as   a   premium  feature,  with zapier itself   requiring  an   expensive   subscription   to  actually  work,  is   a  pretty  damn dick move.
